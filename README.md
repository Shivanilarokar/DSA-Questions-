## Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to structure a DSA question:

### Question: What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a list comprises two items: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

### Solution:
A linked list can be implemented as follows in Python:

```python
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```
