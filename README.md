```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage 📖
Here’s an example of how to approach a DSA question:

### Example Question: Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

**Input:**
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

**Output:**
```python
[0, 1]  # Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
```

### Example Function
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in hashmap:
            return [hashmap[complement], i]
        hashmap[num] = i
```
