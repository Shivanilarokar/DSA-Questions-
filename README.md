# DSA Questions Repository Update

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant enhancements to the existing Python scripts, `python.py` and `shivani.py`, to improve functionality and maintainability. The changes focus on optimizing algorithms, enhancing readability, and ensuring that the code adheres to best practices in Python programming. These updates not only streamline the overall performance but also make it easier for contributors to understand and expand upon the existing solutions.

The updates are part of our ongoing effort to provide high-quality data structure and algorithm questions, along with their solutions. As we adapt to new challenges and user feedback, we aim to maintain an engaging and educational experience for developers and learners alike. 

## Highlights of Changes

- **Refactored Code**: Both `python.py` and `shivani.py` have undergone code refactoring to improve clarity and efficiency.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: New features have been added to provide more comprehensive solutions to the algorithmic problems presented.
- **Improved Documentation**: Inline comments and docstrings have been added to enhance understanding of the code.

### Before and After Code Examples

#### Before (python.py)

```python
def old_function(arr):
    result = []
    for i in arr:
        if i not in result:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

#### After (python.py)

```python
def unique_elements(arr):
    """Return a list of unique elements from the input array."""
    return list(set(arr))
```

#### Before (shivani.py)

```python
def calc_sum(a, b):
    return a + b
```

#### After (shivani.py)

```python
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function names have been updated to be more descriptive, which may require changes in any dependent code that references the old function names.
- The return types have been explicitly defined in the function signatures to enhance type safety.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this update, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher is recommended).

3. Run the test scripts:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

4. Check the output to verify that all tests pass successfully.

5. Review the updated functions in `python.py` and `shivani.py` to understand the changes and their implications.
