```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage 📖
Here’s an example of how to approach a DSA question:

### Example Question: Two Sum
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    # Code logic goes here
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
