- Well-structured solutions in Python.
- Easy to contribute and enhance the repository with your own solutions.

## Summary of the Changes
Recent updates to the README.md include:
- Added a more descriptive title with an emoji for visual appeal.
- Enhanced the section on exploring the repository and contributing solutions.
- Included an example usage of a sorting algorithm with code snippets for clarity.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

Navigate to the directory and explore the various DSA problems available. You can also contribute by adding your own solutions.

## Usage
Here's an example of how to structure your solution:

```python
# Example usage of a sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Sample array
sample_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(sample_array)
print("Sorted array is:", sample_array)
```

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute your solutions or improvements!
