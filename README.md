Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- ü§ñ **User-friendly interface for learning**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been refined to enhance clarity and usability:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight the repository's main offerings.
- Minor formatting adjustments for improved readability.
- Enhanced descriptions to make the repository's purpose clearer.
- Updated the example section to provide a clearer demonstration of a Python function calculating Fibonacci numbers.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage
Explore the repository, practice the questions, and enhance your DSA skills! Below is an example of a Python function that calculates Fibonacci numbers:

```python
# Sample Python function to demonstrate a DSA question
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
