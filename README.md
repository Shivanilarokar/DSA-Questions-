Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- ü§ñ **Structured approach for practicing DSA**

## Summary of the Changes
In this latest update, the README.md file has been auto-updated to include a new **Features** section and refined code examples for better clarity. The changes enhance the overall structure and readability of the documentation.

### Notable Changes:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight the repository's offerings.
- Improved the example code snippet to better illustrate function implementation.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the directory and explore the available questions and solutions. You can run the code snippets to practice and test your understanding of DSA concepts.

## Example
Here's a quick example of how you might implement a function to solve a simple DSA problem:

```python
def example_function(arr):
    # Implementation of some DSA algorithm
    return sorted(arr)
```
