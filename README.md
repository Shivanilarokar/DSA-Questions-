# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

In this update, the README file has been enhanced to provide clearer guidance on the structure and purpose of the repository. The modifications aim to improve user engagement and understanding of the various data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions included in the repository. Additionally, we have added examples and explanations that illustrate the practical applications of the algorithms, making it easier for users to grasp core concepts.

The revised README also introduces a new section dedicated to showcasing before-and-after code snippets. This will help users visualize the improvements made in the codebase and understand the evolution of specific algorithms. Furthermore, the overall formatting has been improved for better readability and aesthetics, ensuring that users can navigate the document effortlessly.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved clarity and structure of the README to facilitate understanding.
- **Before/After Code Examples**: Added examples demonstrating the implementation of specific algorithms before and after optimizations.
- **Readability Improvements**: Updated formatting for a cleaner, more professional appearance.

### Before/After Examples

**Before Optimization:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**After Optimization:**
```python
def optimized_bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    swapped = True
    while swapped:
        swapped = False
        for i in range(n-1):
            if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
                arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
                swapped = True
    return arr
```
