### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
## Binary Search
A binary search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Binary Search
A binary search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

### Example Usage
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1

# Example
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(binary_search(arr, 3))  # Output: 2
```
```
