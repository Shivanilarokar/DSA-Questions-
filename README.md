- **Code Examples**: Added concise examples to demonstrate the usage of key data structures and algorithms, making it easier for users to grasp concepts quickly.
- **Testing Instructions**: A new section detailing how to test the implementations has been added, ensuring that users can validate their work effectively.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions
A collection of data structures and algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions Repository

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms designed to enhance coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Code Examples
### Example of a Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

No breaking changes were introduced in this update. The modifications made are purely enhancements to the existing documentation and do not affect the underlying codebase or the functionality of the algorithms provided.

## How to Test

To test the implementations in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite to ensure everything is functioning correctly:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Optionally, you can run individual tests for specific algorithms by navigating to the relevant directory and executing:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest test_filename.py
   ```
