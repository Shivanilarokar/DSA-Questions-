This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- ü§ù **Open to community contributions!**

## Summary of Changes
In the most recent update, the README.md file has been modified to enhance clarity and improve the presentation of features. Key changes include:

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
This repository provides a variety of DSA questions to practice. Each question can be explored for detailed solutions and explanations. We encourage contributions and exploration of the repository to enhance your learning experience! ü§ó

## Example
Here‚Äôs a brief example of how you might approach a DSA question:

```python
# Example of a simple function to demonstrate DSA concept
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_seq = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
    return fib_seq
```

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enjoy solving DSA problems!
