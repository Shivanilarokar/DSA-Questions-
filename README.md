# DSA Questions Repository 📚

Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms questions along with their solutions. 🧠

## Features 🌟
- Implementations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Algorithms covering sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
- Clear and concise explanations for each question and solution.

## Summary of the Changes 📝
In the latest update, the following changes were made:

1. **Updated Introduction**: Enhanced the introduction to make it more welcoming and informative.
2. **Header Update**: Changed the section title from "Summary of Changes" to "Summary of the Changes" for clarity.
3. **Removed Notebook File**: The `Day1.ipynb` file containing initial DSA questions and their explanations was removed.
4. **Improved Functionality**:
   - Enhanced the `BankAccount` class in `function.py` to handle deposits and withdrawals more effectively.
   - Added a default balance parameter to the `BankAccount` constructor.
   - Included print statements to provide feedback on deposit and withdrawal actions.
   - Enhanced error handling for insufficient funds during withdrawals.
5. **Minor Adjustments**: Made minor adjustments to improve readability and structure throughout the README.

### Code Snippet
Here's a glimpse of the updated `BankAccount` class:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"{amount} deposited. New balance: ₹{self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds!")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"{amount} withdrawn. New balance: ₹{self.balance}")

    def show_balance(self):
        print(f"Account Balance for {self.owner}: ₹{self.balance}")
```

### Example Usage
Here are some snippets from the modified sections:

```python
# Example Usage
acc = BankAccount("John Doe", 1000)
acc.deposit(500)
acc.withdraw(2000)
acc.show_balance()
```
