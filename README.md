Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions, helping you enhance your problem-solving skills.

## Features
- A wide range of DSA problems.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of Changes
In the latest commit, the `README.md` file has been updated to improve clarity and enhance the descriptions of the repository's purpose and features. The following changes were made:
- Updated the overview section to clarify the repository's intent.
- Minor adjustments in wording for better readability.
- Code snippets were modified for consistency in variable naming.

### Code Snippet Changes
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_seq = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
    return fib_seq
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Navigate through the different folders to explore various DSA problems and their solutions. You can run the provided code snippets directly in your Python environment to see the results.

## Example usage
Here's an example of how to use the Fibonacci function defined in this repository:
```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
