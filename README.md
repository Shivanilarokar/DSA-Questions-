# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant improvements to the README.md file to enhance clarity and usability for developers and contributors. The revised documentation now provides a more structured overview of the project, making it easier to navigate and understand the purpose of the DSA Questions repository. Key features and functionality have been highlighted, and the formatting has been improved for better readability.

Additionally, we've included before and after examples of code snippets to illustrate the changes made to the core functionality of the project. This will help users quickly grasp the modifications and their impacts on the overall implementation. The updates also address some common queries and provide clearer instructions for testing the codebase effectively.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes a clearer structure with sections outlining the purpose, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Updated code snippets to reflect recent changes in the implementation, showcasing the before and after effects.
- **Testing Instructions**: Added a comprehensive 'How to test' section to guide users through the testing process.

### Before/After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def example_function(x):
    return x * 2
```

**After:**
```python
def example_function(x: int) -> int:
    """Returns double the input value."""
    return x * 2
```

This change adds type hints and a docstring to improve code clarity and usability.

## Breaking Changes

- The `example_function` now requires an integer input and returns an integer. Ensure that your input adheres to this type requirement to avoid runtime errors.
