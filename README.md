Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- üó∫Ô∏è **User-friendly structure for easy navigation**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide additional guidance on the Fibonacci function. The changes include:
- Added a section for examples demonstrating how to use the Fibonacci function.
- Updated phrasing in the installation instructions for better clarity.

### Code Snippet of the Fibonacci Function
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    # Calculate the Fibonacci series up to n terms
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_series = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_series.append(fib_series[i - 1] + fib_series[i - 2])
    return fib_series
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
# Install dependencies (if any)
```

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, you can start exploring the DSA questions and solutions. Make sure to check the code for any additional usage instructions specific to the solutions provided.

## Example
To use the Fibonacci function, simply call it with the desired number of terms:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
