## Installation üöÄ
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

After cloning the repository, you can navigate to the specific problem directory and follow the usage instructions provided in the repository to run the examples and test your solutions.

## Example
Here's a simple example of a DSA problem solution:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_seq = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_seq.append(fib_seq[i - 1] + fib_seq[i - 2])
        return fib_seq

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
