Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ✍️ **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- 🔍 **User-friendly structure for easy navigation**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the following changes have been made to enhance the clarity and maintainability of the code:

- Improved input handling in the Fibonacci function to handle edge cases more effectively.

Here are some snippets showing the changes made:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:  # Changed from n == 0 to n <= 0 for better handling of input
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]  # Initializing the Fibonacci sequence
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2])  # Append the next Fibonacci number
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and run the desired scripts or functions to practice DSA questions.

## Example
To use the Fibonacci function, simply call it with the desired number of terms:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
