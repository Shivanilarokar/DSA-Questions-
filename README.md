## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions along with their solutions, serving as a valuable resource for both learning and teaching.

## Features
- A wide range of DSA questions categorized by topic.
- Clear and concise code solutions in Python.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of the Changes
Recent updates have enhanced the `README.md` file with clearer instructions and examples. Notable changes include:
- **Clarity Improvements:** Removed redundant sections for better clarity and conciseness.
- **Formatting Updates:** Enhanced readability through improved formatting.
- **Example Section:** Streamlined the example section while retaining essential information.

### Code Snippet Changes
Hereâ€™s a quick look at the updated Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:  # Updated to handle edge cases
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
