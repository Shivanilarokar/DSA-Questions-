- Solutions and explanations for each problem.
- Collaborative environment for contributors to improve and expand the repository. 🎉

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide additional information:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight the repository's offerings.
- Enhanced the example section with a specific implementation of the Fibonacci function.

```

## Usage
You can use the implemented algorithms directly from the repository. Below is an example of the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
