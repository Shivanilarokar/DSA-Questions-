# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository focuses on enhancing the clarity and usability of the README file. The primary goal was to provide improved documentation for contributors and users alike, ensuring that essential information about the project, its structure, and how to contribute is readily available. A well-structured README not only helps onboard new contributors but also serves as a quick reference for anyone looking to understand the project.

Additionally, we have included more detailed examples of data structures and algorithms to illustrate their implementation. This change aims to provide a clearer understanding of how to utilize the code effectively, making it easier for users to grasp complex concepts. The update also emphasizes best practices in coding and testing, ensuring that the community adheres to high standards.

## Highlights of the Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity in project description and usage instructions.
- **Code Examples**: Added small, illustrative code snippets for key data structures and algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clearer instructions for contributing to the project, including coding standards and testing protocols.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a basic linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

**After:**
```python
# Example of a basic linked list with a method to append data
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
    
    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node
```

## Breaking Changes

No breaking changes have been introduced in this update. The existing functionality remains unchanged, ensuring that current users and contributors can continue their work without disruption.
