## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions along with their solutions. It aims to help developers and learners practice and enhance their problem-solving skills.

## Features
- A wide range of DSA questions categorized by topics.
- Clear and concise solutions with explanations.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, several modifications were made to enhance the `README.md` file:
- Consolidated badge display for better aesthetics.
- Removed redundant instructions regarding exploring the directory.
- Updated the Fibonacci function example to improve clarity and functionality.
- Revised the contribution section for a more concise message.

### Code Changes
Here are some snippets showcasing the changes made:

#### Updated Fibonacci Function Example
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
