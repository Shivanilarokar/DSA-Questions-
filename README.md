Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Overview
This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of curated questions and their solutions.

## Features
- Extensive collection of DSA questions ðŸ“š
- Clear and structured solutions for each question
- Community-driven contributions

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the `README.md` file has been enhanced with the following changes:
- Changed the repository title emoji from ðŸš€ to ðŸŒŸ for a more dynamic representation.
- Added a **Usage** section to guide users on how to explore and interact with the DSA questions and solutions.
- Included a **Contribution** section to encourage community involvement and provide guidelines for contributing to the repository.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and explore the various DSA questions and their solutions. Feel free to run the code snippets in your local environment to test and modify them as needed.

## Example
Here's a brief example of how to implement a simple DSA question:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

We hope you find this repository helpful for your DSA learning journey! Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
