# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant enhancements to the `README.md` file, aimed at improving clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The modifications include better section organization, enhanced examples, and clearer instructions for testing. By refining the content structure, we ensure that users can navigate the repository more efficiently and find the information they need quickly.

In addition to structural changes, we have added small code snippets to demonstrate key concepts and usage patterns. These examples serve as practical guides for users looking to implement data structures and algorithms in their projects. The overall goal of this update is to enhance the documentation quality, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the resources available in this repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation Structure:** The README now features a more logical flow, with clearly defined sections for installation, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples:** Added relevant code snippets that illustrate how to implement certain algorithms effectively.
- **Testing Instructions:** Enhanced the section detailing how to run tests, ensuring contributors can easily validate their changes.

### Before and After Code Example

**Before:**
```markdown
Usage:
- To use the algorithms, just call the function.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Usage

To use the algorithms, simply call the function with the appropriate parameters. For example:

```python
result = quick_sort([5, 3, 8, 6])
print(result)  # Output: [3, 5, 6, 8]
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function signatures for some algorithms have been updated for consistency. Ensure that your calls to these functions reflect the new parameters.
- The testing framework has been changed from `unittest` to `pytest`. This may require adjustments in your local testing setup.
