## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, solutions, and resources. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn or an expert aiming to refine your skills, this repository has something for everyone.

## Features
- A wide range of DSA problems covering various topics.
- Solutions in multiple programming languages.
- Code snippets for quick reference and understanding.
- Regular updates and contributions from the community.

## Summary of the Changes
Recent updates to the README.md include enhancements to clarify the project purpose and improve engagement:
- Changed the emoji in the title for better representation.
- Added GitHub badges for forks and stars to enhance visibility and engagement.
- Improved the wording in the contribution section to encourage exploration and contributions.
- Updated the binary search example to provide a clearer demonstration of how to use the algorithm effectively.

### Updated Binary Search Example
Hereâ€™s a quick look at the modified code snippet in the README:

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
result = binary_search(arr, target)
print(f'Target found at index: {result}')  # Output: Target found at index: 2
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
You can explore the various DSA problems and their solutions in the respective folders. To run a specific solution, ensure you have the necessary programming environment set up (e.g., Python, Java, etc.).

## Example
To see the binary search in action, you can use the updated example provided above. Feel free to modify the input array or target value to test different scenarios.
