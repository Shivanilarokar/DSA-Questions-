# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces a series of enhancements to the DSA Questions repository aimed at improving the overall user experience and code organization. We have refined the README to provide clearer guidance on using the repository, including instructions for setup, contribution guidelines, and examples of data structures and algorithms. Additionally, we have optimized the code examples to follow best practices, ensuring that they are both efficient and easy to understand.

The enhancements include a more structured layout, making it easier for users to navigate through the repository. We have also included a dedicated section for breaking changes and updated the testing instructions to facilitate smoother contributions from the community. This carefully curated documentation aims to serve both beginners and experienced developers looking to sharpen their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The README file has been reorganized for better readability and accessibility of information.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise examples to illustrate the implementation of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions on how to contribute have been included to encourage community involvement.
- **Breaking Changes**: Documented any significant changes that may affect existing implementations.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before:
```python
# Example of a simple linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```

#### After:
```python
# Improved Linked List Implementation
class Node:
    """Represents a single node in a linked list."""
    
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    """Represents a linked list."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, value):
        """Appends a new node with the given value to the end of the list."""
        new_node = Node(value)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node
```

## Breaking Changes

- The `LinkedList` class has been introduced to encapsulate the linked list functionality, which may require updates in your existing implementations if you were directly using the `Node` class.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this update, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite to ensure that everything is functioning as expected:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Review the updated README and verify the code examples by implementing them in your local environment.
