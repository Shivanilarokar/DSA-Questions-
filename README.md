## Features âœ¨
- A wide range of DSA problems with solutions.
- Solutions provided in multiple programming languages.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the `README.md` has been enhanced to provide clearer instructions and improve readability. Key changes include:
- Improved the description of the repository.
- Updated the features section for clarity.

To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Once cloned, navigate to the desired directory and explore the DSA questions and their solutions.

### Example
Here is an example of the Fibonacci function implemented in Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = fibonacci(n - 1)
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

Feel free to modify and enhance this function based on your understanding!
