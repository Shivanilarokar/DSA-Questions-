## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project is dedicated to solving various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It is a great resource for developers looking to enhance their skills in DSA.

## Features
- Collection of DSA questions and solutions.
- Easy to navigate and understand code snippets.
- Regular updates to ensure relevance and accuracy.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we have made a small yet significant enhancement to the Fibonacci function, improving code clarity and structure. The changes include:
- Updated the title emoji from ðŸ“š to ðŸ“–.
- Added an `else` clause for better readability in the Fibonacci function.

### Code Changes
Here are the key changes made to the Fibonacci function:

### Updated Code Snippet:
```python
# Example of a Fibonacci function
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:  # Added else clause for clarity
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:
