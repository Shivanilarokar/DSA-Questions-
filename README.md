# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the clarity and usability of the README file, ensuring that contributors and users can quickly understand the purpose of the project and how to get started. The modifications primarily focus on improving the documentation, including clearer instructions for setup, usage, and testing. Additionally, some sections have been reorganized to provide a more logical flow of information.

In this update, we've also added examples of key data structures and algorithms that are central to the project. These examples serve as both a reference for users and a way to demonstrate the functionality of the codebase. By including concise before-and-after scenarios, we aim to illustrate the practical applications of the algorithms covered in the repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced explanations of algorithms and data structures.
- **Code Examples**: Added small, illustrative code snippets for better understanding.
- **Section Reorganization**: Streamlined the README layout for easier navigation.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before

```markdown
## Some Algorithm
This algorithm does something important.
```

#### After

```markdown
## Binary Search Algorithm

The Binary Search algorithm efficiently finds a target value within a sorted array.

### Example

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- None in this update. All changes are additive and aim to enhance documentation without altering existing functionality.

## How to Test
