## Features
- A comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Solutions and explanations for each problem.
- Easy navigation and clear instructions for users.

## Summary of Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide more structured information:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight key aspects of the repository.
- Enhanced the **Usage** section for better guidance on navigating the project.
- Updated the example usage for the Fibonacci sequence problem for clarity.

## Installation
To get started with the repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

You can then explore the various DSA problems and their solutions.

## Usage
Here's a sample solution for the Fibonacci sequence problem:

```python
# Example of a simple DSA problem solution
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence
```

Feel free to explore and contribute to the repository!
