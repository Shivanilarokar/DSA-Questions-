## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the following changes have been made to enhance the clarity and maintainability of the code:

- **Improved Input Handling**: Adjusted the Fibonacci function to better handle edge cases.
- **Code Consistency**: Adjusted the appending logic to use a new variable name, improving clarity and maintainability.

### Code Changes
Here are some snippets showing the changes made:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:  # Changed from n == 0 to n <= 0 for better handling of input
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]  # Initializing the Fibonacci sequence
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2])  # Append the next Fibonacci number
```
