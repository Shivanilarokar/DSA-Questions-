# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have enhanced the README.md file to improve clarity and usability for developers and contributors. The primary goal of these changes is to provide better guidance on how to navigate the repository, understand the data structures, and implement the algorithms effectively. The new sections include a more detailed explanation of the repository's purpose, highlights of key features, and improved code examples to illustrate the implementation of data structures and algorithms.

Additionally, we have addressed some feedback from the community regarding the formatting and structure of the README. By reorganizing the content and adding relevant examples, we aim to create a more engaging and informative experience for users interacting with the repository. This will not only facilitate easier onboarding for new contributors but also serve as a reference point for seasoned developers.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now features a clear hierarchy with headings for easier navigation.
- **Detailed Examples**: Included concise before/after code snippets to illustrate the implementation of algorithms.
- **Community Feedback**: Adjustments made based on suggestions from users to enhance clarity and usability.

### Before/After Example

**Before:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Implementation of binary search
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """Perform binary search on a sorted array.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): A sorted list of integers.
        target (int): The integer to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of target in arr or -1 if not found.
    """
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function signature for `binary_search` has been updated to include a docstring that clarifies its arguments and return value. This change enhances code readability and provides better documentation inline.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite to ensure all algorithms are functioning as expected:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Check the output of the `binary_search` function with various inputs to validate its correctness.
