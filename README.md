# DSA Questions

## Summary
This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the documentation by providing clearer instructions and examples for users. The README file has been revised to ensure that contributors and users can easily navigate the repository and understand the purpose of the various data structures and algorithms included. Improved examples and explanations facilitate a better learning experience for developers at all levels.

Additionally, we've made minor formatting adjustments to improve readability and usability. This ensures that both new and experienced developers can quickly find the information they need, fostering a more engaging and productive environment for exploring data structures and algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced explanations and examples for better clarity.
- **Formatting Updates**: Adjusted the layout for improved readability.
- **New Examples**: Added specific code snippets to illustrate key concepts.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before
In the previous version, the example for binary search was minimal and lacked context:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Implementation
    pass
```

#### After
The updated example provides clear context and explanation:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a sorted array.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): A sorted list of elements.
    target: The element to search for.

    Returns:
    int: The index of the target in the array, or -1 if not found.
    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
