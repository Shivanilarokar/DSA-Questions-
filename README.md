# DSA Questions

Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project contains a curated collection of data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions designed to enhance your coding skills.

## Example Usage

To implement a simple linked list, you can use the following code:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has been significantly modified to improve readability and user experience. While this does not affect the codebase itself, users should refer to the updated sections for the latest instructions and examples.

## How to Test

To ensure that the changes are functioning as intended, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

3. Open the `README.md` file and verify that all sections are clear and the code examples compile correctly.

4. Feel free to run any provided example code in your local Python environment to ensure everything works as described.
