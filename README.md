## Overview
This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions and their solutions. It serves as a resource for developers and students looking to enhance their understanding of DSA concepts through practical coding examples.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions
- Clear and concise solutions in Python
- Easy to navigate and contribute to
- Continuous updates and improvements

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we have made a small yet significant enhancement to the Fibonacci function. An `else` clause has been added for clarity in the recursive logic. This improvement enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.

### Code Changes
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:  # Added else clause for clarity
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

result = fibonacci(10)
print(f"The 10th Fibonacci number is: {result}")
```
