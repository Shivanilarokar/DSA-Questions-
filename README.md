# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have significantly improved the `README.md` file to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users of the DSA Questions repository. The primary focus of this enhancement was to provide a more structured overview of the project, including sections that highlight key features, usage examples, and testing instructions. This will facilitate a better understanding of the project and encourage contributions from developers of all skill levels.

Additionally, we have included a more detailed breakdown of the directory structure, making it easier for users to navigate through the repository. Clear code examples have been added to demonstrate how to utilize the data structures and algorithms provided in the repository effectively. 

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Project Overview**: The introduction now clearly articulates the purpose of the repository and its relevance in practicing data structures and algorithms.
- **Detailed Code Examples**: Small, illustrative code snippets have been added to demonstrate how to implement common data structures and algorithms.
- **Structured Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to test the code has been introduced, guiding users through the testing process.

### Before and After Examples

**Before**: The README lacked clear examples and structured information.

**After**: The README now includes structured sections and examples.

# DSA Questions

## Overview
This repository contains various data structure and algorithm questions, along with their implementations in Python.

## Example Usage
```python
from dsa import BinaryTree

tree = BinaryTree()
tree.insert(10)
tree.insert(5)
tree.insert(15)

print(tree.in_order_traversal())  # Output: [5, 10, 15]
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the `README.md` has been completely overhauled. Users should refer to the new sections for information rather than relying on the previous format.

## How to Test

To ensure that the changes are functioning as expected, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install required dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

4. Verify that all tests pass and review the output for any errors.
