## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems, along with well-documented solutions to aid understanding.

## Features
- A wide range of DSA problems.
- Well-structured solutions with clear explanations.
- Easy to follow installation and usage instructions.
- Continuous updates and contributions from the community.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced for better clarity and structure:
- Improved the introduction for better understanding.
- Updated the installation instructions for clarity.
- Provided an example usage of the Fibonacci function, including expected output.
- Enhanced formatting for better visibility of badges.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
# Install dependencies (if any)
```

## Usage
To use the solutions provided in this repository, simply navigate to the relevant directory and run the desired script. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_seq = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
        return fib_seq

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Expected output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
