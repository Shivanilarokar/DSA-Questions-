# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes
In this update, we've enhanced the `README.md` file to provide clearer documentation and improve user experience for contributors and users alike. The changes include a more structured layout, additional sections for highlights and examples, and improved clarity in the instructions for testing. This will help new contributors understand how to engage with the project more effectively and allow users to navigate the content with ease.

We have also added sections that outline the changes made to the codebase, which include specific examples of before and after code snippets. This will help in demonstrating the improvements and provide a clear understanding of the modifications. The goal is to ensure that both current and future contributors have a solid foundation to build upon as they contribute to the project.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity and structure in the `README.md`.
- **Before/After Examples**: Added code snippets to illustrate changes.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clearer guidelines on how to run tests.

### Before/After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

**After:**
```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return x + y
```
The updated function now includes type hints and a docstring, improving code readability and usability.

## Breaking Changes
- The function `add` now requires integer arguments due to added type hints. Ensure that all calls to this function are updated accordingly.
