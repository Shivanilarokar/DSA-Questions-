## Summary

This update enhances the `README.md` file to provide clearer guidance on the project's structure, usage, and contribution guidelines. The changes aim to improve the onboarding experience for new contributors and users, making it easier to navigate through the repository and understand how to utilize the data structures and algorithms provided. By refining the documentation, we hope to foster a more vibrant community around the DSA Questions repository.

In addition to updating the content, we've also standardized the formatting to ensure consistency across sections. This makes the README not only more informative but also visually appealing. The goal is to make it straightforward for anyone interested to get started with the project, whether they are looking to solve specific data structure or algorithm problems or contribute to the repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Structure**: The README now features a well-defined structure, including sections for installation, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Small code snippets have been added to illustrate how to use the algorithms effectively, making it easier for users to understand implementation details.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions on how to contribute to the repository have been included, encouraging more community involvement.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown

## Overview
This repository contains various data structure and algorithm questions, solutions, and discussions.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
cd DSA-Questions
```

## Usage
Here is a simple example of how to use the binary search algorithm:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- **Revised Section Titles**: Some section titles have been renamed for clarity and consistency. Users should refer to the new section names when navigating the README.
- **Updated Code Snippets**: All code snippets have been reviewed and updated to reflect best practices. Existing users may need to adapt their usage based on these changes.
