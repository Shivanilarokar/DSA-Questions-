# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces enhancements to the README.md file, providing clearer documentation and better guidance to users. The changes aim to improve the overall user experience by making it easier for developers and learners to navigate the repository and understand the resources available. With these updates, users will find essential information about the project, how to contribute, and how to utilize the resources effectively.

We have also streamlined the examples in the documentation, showcasing the key data structures and algorithms. By providing concise before-and-after examples, we hope to illustrate the practical application of the concepts covered in this repository. This will help users grasp the material quickly and apply it to their own projects or studies.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved clarity and organization in the README to facilitate easier understanding.
- **Code Examples**: Updated examples demonstrating the application of data structures and algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Added clear instructions on how to contribute to the repository, encouraging community involvement.

### Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a simple linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved linked list example with additional methods
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node
```

## Breaking Changes
