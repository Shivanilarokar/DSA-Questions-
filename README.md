## Overview
This repository contains a curated list of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions aimed at helping developers enhance their problem-solving skills.

## Code Example
Here is a simple example of how to implement a binary search in Python:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```
