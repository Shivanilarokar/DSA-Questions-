## Usage 💻
To use the DSA solutions, simply navigate through the directory of the problem you are interested in and run the corresponding Python file. Here's a simple example of how to use the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

## Example 📚
Here’s a quick look at the Fibonacci function implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
