# DSA Questions 🚀

Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for practicing and enhancing your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills.

## Overview 🌟
This repository contains a collection of DSA questions along with their solutions. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for students and developers looking to improve their problem-solving skills.

## Features 🛠️
- A wide range of DSA questions covering various topics.
- Clear and concise solutions with explanations.
- Code snippets with examples to facilitate understanding.

## Summary of the Changes 📝
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Addition of a new **Features** section for improved organization.
- Improved code snippet for a simple DSA question solution using the Fibonacci sequence for better clarity and performance.
- Updated the **Installation** section to facilitate easier setup.

### Example Code Snippet
Here's an improved example of a Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
