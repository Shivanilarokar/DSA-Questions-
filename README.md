## Summary of Changes

This update to the `DSA-Questions` repository enhances the README file to provide clearer guidance on the project, its structure, and how to contribute effectively. The updates aim to improve onboarding for new contributors and users by clarifying the purpose of the repository and providing more structured information. By refining the content, we hope to foster a more collaborative and informed community around data structure and algorithm questions.

In addition to improving the overall readability, we have added examples demonstrating how to use specific algorithms and data structures covered in the repository. This allows users to quickly grasp the practical applications of the concepts discussed and facilitates easier navigation through the resources provided.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Project Overview:** The introduction now provides a succinct description of what the repository contains, including the types of data structures and algorithms covered.
- **Code Examples:** Added small code snippets to illustrate the usage of key algorithms, making it easier for users to understand implementation details.
- **Contribution Guidelines:** Enhanced guidelines to encourage community contributions and clarify the steps for submitting pull requests.

### Code Example Before and After

**Before:**
```plaintext
This repository contains various data structure and algorithm questions.
```

**After:**
```markdown
This repository contains a curated collection of data structure and algorithm questions, along with solutions and explanations. It serves as a resource for learners and practitioners to improve their coding skills.
```

### Example of Algorithm Usage

**Before:**
```plaintext
Refer to the code files for examples.
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Example: Binary Search

Here's a simple implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Python:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
This function takes a sorted array and a target value, returning the index of the target if found, or -1 if not.
```

## Breaking Changes

None. This update only modifies the README file and does not affect the underlying code or functionality of the repository.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Open the `README.md` file in your preferred Markdown viewer to see the changes in effect.
3. Review the code examples to ensure they are correctly formatted and functional.
4. If you have suggestions for further improvements, consider forking the repository and submitting a pull request.
