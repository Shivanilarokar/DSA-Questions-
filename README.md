## Summary of Changes
In this update, we have made significant improvements to the `README.md` file to enhance usability and clarity for developers and contributors. The changes focus on providing a more structured overview of the repository, clearer documentation of features, and better instructions for testing. This will help users quickly understand the purpose of the repository and how to effectively contribute.

The updated README now includes a concise summary of the project, highlights of key features, and clear examples of usage. Additionally, we have included a dedicated section for breaking changes, ensuring that users are aware of any modifications that may affect their existing implementations. Overall, these changes aim to create a better onboarding experience for new contributors and provide a comprehensive resource for all users.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Enhanced Project Overview**: A clearer description of the purpose and scope of the repository.
- **Code Examples**: Added before/after code snippets to illustrate usage and improvements.

- **Testing Instructions**: Provided detailed steps for testing the repository.

### Before/After Code Examples
**Before:**
```python
def example_function(param):
