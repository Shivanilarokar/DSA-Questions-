# DSA-Questions Update

## Summary of Changes
This update to the DSA-Questions repository introduces enhancements to the README.md file, providing clearer guidance and improved content structure for users and contributors alike. The goal is to make the documentation more accessible and informative, ensuring that both beginners and advanced users can navigate the repository effectively. 

In addition to refining the overall presentation, we've included detailed sections outlining the purpose of the repository, highlights of the data structures and algorithms covered, and practical examples to facilitate understanding. This change aims to elevate the user experience and encourage active participation from the community.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Structure**: The README now features a well-defined structure, making it easier to find relevant information.
- **Code Examples**: Added before and after examples to illustrate how to utilize various data structures and algorithms effectively.
- **Testing Instructions**: A new section on testing has been added to guide users through validating their implementations.

### Before and After Examples
Hereâ€™s a quick comparison of how to implement a simple binary search:

**Before:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

**After:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """Performs binary search on a sorted array."""
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
    return -1  # Target not found
```

## Breaking Changes
No breaking changes were introduced in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, ensuring backward compatibility with previous implementations.

## How to Test
To test the changes made in this update, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
