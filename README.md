## Features
- A comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Solutions and explanations for each problem.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, we have made the following changes to the README.md file:
- **Refined Example**: Updated the Fibonacci function example to improve clarity and correctness.
- **Formatting Improvements**: Enhanced the overall structure for better readability.

### Code Changes
Here’s a quick look at the modified Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
You can run the provided Python scripts to solve various DSA problems. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

### Example
Here’s a simple example of how to use the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
