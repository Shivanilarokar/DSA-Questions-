# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes
This update enhances the existing documentation of the DSA Questions repository, making it more user-friendly and informative for developers and learners alike. The README has been restructured to provide clearer guidance on the repository's purpose, usage, and contribution process. Additionally, examples have been added to illustrate how to implement the data structures and algorithms (DSA) effectively.

Furthermore, the update introduces a new section dedicated to breaking changes, ensuring that contributors are aware of significant modifications that may affect their work. This is particularly important as the repository evolves and expands its capabilities.

## Highlights of the Changes
- **Improved Documentation Structure**: The README now follows a more logical flow, making it easier to navigate.
- **Code Examples**: Small code snippets have been added to showcase the usage of various algorithms and data structures.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: A clear outline of breaking changes has been added to inform users of any significant modifications.

### Before and After Examples

**Before**: Usage instructions were vague and lacked examples.
```markdown
# Usage
You can use the algorithms in this repo.
```

**After**: Clear usage instructions with examples.
```markdown
# Usage
To use the sorting algorithms, import the module and call the function:
```python
from sorting import quicksort

data = [5, 3, 8, 6, 2]
sorted_data = quicksort(data)
print(sorted_data)  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
```
```

## Breaking Changes
- **Function Signature Changes**: The `merge_sort` function now requires an additional parameter for the sorting order. Please ensure to update your calls accordingly.
- **Module Renaming**: The `utils` module has been renamed to `helpers`. Update your imports to reflect this change.

## How to Test
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the test suite to ensure everything is functioning as expected:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```
