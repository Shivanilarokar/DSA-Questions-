# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have improved the documentation in the `README.md` file to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users of the DSA Questions repository. The primary focus was on providing more comprehensive explanations of the data structures and algorithms covered in the repository, thus making it easier for users to understand the context and applications of each question. Additionally, we have added examples for better illustration and guidance.

These changes were made in response to user feedback indicating that certain sections of the README were ambiguous or lacked sufficient detail. By elaborating on key concepts and including more practical examples, we aim to foster a more user-friendly environment that encourages learning and engagement with the material.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Expanded Explanations**: Detailed descriptions of various data structures and algorithms have been added.
- **Code Examples**: Small code snippets for key algorithms have been included to provide clarity on implementation.
- **Improved Formatting**: Enhanced the overall layout for better readability and navigation.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
## Binary Search
Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Binary Search

Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It operates by dividing the search interval in half repeatedly. If the target value is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the search continues in the lower half, or if it is greater, in the upper half.

### Example Implementation in Python:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. The enhancements made are purely documentation-related and do not alter any existing code functionality.

## How to Test

To verify the changes made in this update, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
