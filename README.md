## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions.
- Solutions implemented in Python.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of the Changes
Recent updates have enhanced the README.md file with clearer instructions and an improved example for the Fibonacci sequence function. Key changes include:
- Revised the example usage of the Fibonacci function to provide better clarity.
- Updated the implementation of the Fibonacci function for better efficiency.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance the collection of DSA questions and solutions!

## Example: Fibonacci Sequence
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Fibonacci function included in this repository:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
