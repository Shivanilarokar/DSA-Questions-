# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the `README.md` enhances the documentation of the DSA Questions repository by providing clearer instructions on how to navigate the codebase, execute the algorithms, and understand the data structures used. Additionally, we have added a section that highlights the purpose of each algorithm and its application in solving common data structure and algorithm problems. This improved clarity aims to assist both beginners and experienced developers in utilizing the repository effectively.

The README now includes detailed examples that illustrate how to implement specific algorithms, making it easier for users to understand the practical application of the code. Furthermore, we have reorganized the content to improve readability and ensure that critical information is easily accessible.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Clarity**: Enhanced explanations of algorithms and data structures.
- **Code Examples**: Added practical code snippets for better understanding.
- **Navigation**: Reorganized sections for easier access to important information.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: Simple comparison-based algorithm.
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

### Searching Algorithms
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays.
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, and the new changes are additive, enhancing the documentation without altering any underlying code.

## How to Test

To test the updates made in this README, clone the repository and navigate to the desired algorithm's directory. Run the provided code examples in a Python environment to verify their functionality. Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can execute the examples as follows:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the algorithm examples:
   ```bash
   python sorting/bubble_sort.py
   python searching/binary_search.py
   ```

3. Validate the outputs against expected results.
