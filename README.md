## Installation
To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

You can navigate through the repository to find various DSA questions and their corresponding solutions. Here‚Äôs an example of how to use the Fibonacci function:

```python
# Sample Python function to demonstrate a DSA question
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input cannot be negative")
    # Fibonacci logic goes here
```

## Usage
You can explore the repository for various DSA problems and solutions. Feel free to contribute by adding more questions or improving existing solutions.

## Example
Here‚Äôs how you can use the Fibonacci function in your code:

```python
try:
    result = fibonacci(10)
    print(f"Fibonacci of 10: {result}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```
