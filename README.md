This repository is dedicated to helping developers and students improve their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through a collection of curated questions and solutions.

## Features âœ¨
- A collection of DSA questions to practice and enhance your skills.
- Solutions provided in Python for easy understanding.

## Summary of Changes
In the latest update, the README has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability:
- Added a **Features** section to outline the benefits of the repository.
- Updated the language in the **Usage** section for better readability.
- Refined the example code to improve clarity and accuracy in the Fibonacci function.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

You can start practicing with the DSA questions by navigating to the respective directories.

## Usage
Explore the various DSA questions and their solutions. Each question is designed to help you practice and understand different concepts in data structures and algorithms.

## Example
Hereâ€™s an example of a simple Python function demonstrating a common algorithm:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2])
    return fib_sequence
```
This function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number, showcasing a practical application of recursion and iteration.

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding more questions and solutions! Happy coding! ðŸ’»
