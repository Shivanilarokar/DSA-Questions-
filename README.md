This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- üìë **Structured example format for better understanding**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:

1. Added a **Features** section for better visibility of repository capabilities.
2. Updated the clone command to include `.git` for consistency.
3. Enhanced the **Usage** section with a clearer example of how to utilize a function from the repository.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Feel free to explore the repository and practice the DSA questions provided. Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to use a function from the repository:

```python
# Example of a simple DSA question solution
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib = fibonacci(n-1)
        fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])
        return fib
```

Explore, contribute, and improve your DSA skills with us! Happy coding! üéâ
