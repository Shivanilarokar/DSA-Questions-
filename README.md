# DSA Questions Repository Update

## Summary

This update enhances the documentation of the DSA Questions repository, providing clearer instructions and examples for users and contributors. The README now includes a more structured layout, making it easier to navigate and understand the project's purpose. The enhancements aim to improve the onboarding experience for new contributors and assist users in quickly finding the information they need.

In addition to updating the overall structure, we've added specific examples to illustrate how to utilize various data structures and algorithms effectively. This will not only serve as a reference for best practices but also demonstrate the practical application of the concepts discussed in the repository. 

## Highlights of the Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: The README now features a clearer introduction, outlining the purpose and scope of the project.
- **Code Examples**: We've included small examples showcasing how to implement specific data structures and algorithms. This will help users understand the practical applications of the questions provided.
- **Structured Sections**: The README is now divided into distinct sections for better readability, including installation instructions, usage, and contribution guidelines.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before

```markdown
# DSA Questions
Some questions related to data structures and algorithms.
```

#### After

```markdown
# DSA Questions

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of questions and solutions focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Highlights
- Improved documentation
- Code examples
- Structured sections

## Example: Implementing a Stack
```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        return self.items.pop() if not self.is_empty() else None

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has been significantly modified, which may affect any direct links to specific sections. Please refer to the new layout for updated navigation.
- The examples provided have been standardized to follow Python conventions. Users should ensure their implementations align with these examples for consistency.

## How to Test
