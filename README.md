# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces enhancements to the README file, improving clarity and usability for developers and contributors. The primary goal was to provide a more structured overview of the repository, including a clear explanation of its purpose, highlights of key features, and usage examples. Additionally, we have made it easier for potential contributors to understand how to test the code effectively.

In this update, we've also emphasized the importance of certain files and provided a better-organized layout to ensure that users can quickly find relevant information. This will help new users onboard more efficiently and encourage community contributions.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced the README to include detailed sections for summaries, highlights, and usage examples.
- **Code Examples**: Added small before/after code snippets to illustrate the changes and usage of the algorithms effectively.
- **Testing Instructions**: Included a dedicated section on how to test the code, making it easier for contributors to validate their changes.

### Before & After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**After:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break
    return arr
```
*The improved version includes an optimization that stops the algorithm if no swaps occur during a pass, enhancing performance.*

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update; however, users are encouraged to review the new documentation and examples to fully utilize the features and improvements made in the algorithms.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

3. Review the results to ensure all tests pass successfully. You can add new test cases to the `tests` directory to cover additional scenarios.
