You can explore the questions and solutions directly in the repository. Each solution is well-documented to help you understand the underlying concepts.

## Example Code Snippet 🐍
Here’s an example of how to use the Fibonacci function with edge case handling:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 1:
        return "Input should be a positive integer"
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(0))  # Output: Input should be a positive integer
```

This function now includes handling for edge cases, ensuring robustness.
