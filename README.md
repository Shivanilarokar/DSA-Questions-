Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to enhance your coding skills and problem-solving abilities. Explore a wide range of DSA challenges with clear and concise code implementations.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems categorized by type, with clear and concise implementations in Python. It serves as a learning resource for those looking to enhance their understanding of algorithms.

## Features
- A wide variety of DSA problems.
- Clear and concise code implementations in Python.
- Categorized problems for easy navigation.

## Summary of the Changes
In this recent update, several modifications were made to improve the clarity and presentation of the README file. Key changes include:
- Enhanced the introduction to better convey the purpose of the repository.
- Minor edits to the overview section for improved readability.
- Updated an implementation of the binary search algorithm for clarity.

### Code Snippet Changes
Hereâ€™s the updated binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2  # Improved clarity
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, you can explore the various DSA problems available. Each problem is accompanied by its solution, which you can run and test in your Python environment.

## Example
To use the binary search function, you can call it as follows:

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
result = binary_search(arr, target)
print(f'Target found at index: {result}')  # Output: Target found at index: 2
```
