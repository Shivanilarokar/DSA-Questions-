## Installation

To get started with this project, you must first install the required dependencies. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here are examples of how to use the newly introduced function within the FastAPI application component:

### FastAPI Webhook

This function sets up a webhook that listens for GitHub events such as push events and pull requests.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Header
import logging
import sys
from typing import Optional

# Setup logger
logger = logging.getLogger("FastAPIWebhook")
handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
formatter = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s")
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(handler)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Initialize FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhook")
async def webhook(
    request: Request,
    x_hub_signature_256: Optional[str] = Header(None),
    x_github_event: Optional[str] = Header(None),
):
    body = await request.body()
    payload = await request.json()
    logger.info("ðŸ“¬ Received %s event", x_github_event)

    # Implementation of event handling can go here
```

### Sample Event Handling

This sample demonstrates how to process different GitHub webhook events:

```python
@app.post("/webhook")
async def webhook(
    request: Request,
    x_hub_signature_256: Optional[str] = Header(None),
    x_github_event: Optional[str] = Header(None),
):
    ...
    if x_github_event == "push":
        bot_user = payload.get("pusher", {}).get("name")
    elif x_github_event == "pull_request":
        bot_user = payload.get("sender", {}).get("login")
    # Process webhook event
    logger.info("ðŸ“¬ Processing webhook event from bot: %s", bot_user)
```

## API Documentation

### `webhook(request: Request, x_hub_signature_256: Optional[str] = Header(None), x_github_event: Optional[str] = Header(None))`

- **Description**: This endpoint processes incoming GitHub webhook events.
- **Parameters**:
  - `request`: The incoming HTTP request.
  - `x_hub_signature_256`: Optional header containing the signature of the webhook.
  - `x_github_event`: Optional header containing the type of the GitHub event.
- **Returns**: None

## What's New

- Introduced a new FastAPI based webhook listener for GitHub events, enabling better integration and automation based on push and pull request events.
- Improved logging throughout the webhook process to assist in debugging and event tracking.
