Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions aimed at helping developers and students enhance their problem-solving skills.

## Overview
This repository serves as a collaborative platform for DSA enthusiasts. It is designed to provide clear explanations and code snippets for various DSA problems, making it easier for users to understand and learn.

## Features
- Extensive collection of DSA questions.
- Clear explanations and code snippets.
- Organized sections for easy navigation.
- Community-driven contributions.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the following changes were made:
- Updated the README structure to include a dedicated **"Overview"** and **"Features"** section.
- Improved the wording in the features section for clarity.
- Separated the usage instructions into its own section for better organization.
- Enhanced the Fibonacci function example to clarify its output.

### Code Snippet Changes
Hereâ€™s an example of the updated Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
