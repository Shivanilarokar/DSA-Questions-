The primary aim of these changes is to enhance the onboarding experience for new contributors while ensuring that existing users can quickly find the information they need. 

Key updates include a clearer overview of the repository's purpose, a more organized list of features, and improved code examples that demonstrate how to utilize the data structures and algorithms provided. Additionally, the breaking changes section has been added to inform users of any incompatibilities introduced in this version.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Overview**: The introduction now concisely describes the purpose of the repository, outlining its focus on data structures and algorithms.
- **Improved Code Examples**: Clearer and more relevant code snippets have been added to demonstrate usage, including before and after scenarios.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: A dedicated section to inform users of any changes that may affect existing implementations.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions
This repo contains various DSA questions.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions Repository

Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project contains a collection of data structures and algorithms questions designed to help developers enhance their problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.
```

**Code Example:**

**Before:**
```python
def example_function(data):
    # process data
    return data
```

**After:**
```python
def process_data(data):
    """
    Process the input data and return the result.
    
    Parameters:
    data (list): A list of integers to process.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing processed integers.
    """
    return [x * 2 for x in data]
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function names have been standardized for better clarity. For example, `example_function` has been renamed to `process_data`. Ensure to update any references in your code accordingly.

## How to Test

To test the changes made to the repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
