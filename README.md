In this update, the `README.md` file has been enhanced for better readability and clarity. The following changes were made:

### Key Changes:
- Added an **Overview** section to provide context about the repository.
- Improved formatting and clarity in the README.
- Enhanced the example of the Fibonacci function implementation.

### Code Snippet Example
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    return fib_sequence
```

## Installation ðŸ’»
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```
Then navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage ðŸš€
You can explore various DSA problems and their solutions. To use the Fibonacci function, simply call it with the desired number of terms:
```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n_terms = 10
    print(fibonacci(n_terms))
```
