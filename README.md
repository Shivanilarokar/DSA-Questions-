# DSA Questions Repository

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the documentation within the `README.md` file. The changes aim to provide clearer guidance on how to navigate the repository, utilize the data structures and algorithms presented, and contribute effectively. By improving the clarity of the README, we hope to foster a more engaging and supportive environment for current and future contributors.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes more detailed explanations of the directory structure, the purpose of the repository, and how to run the provided algorithms.
- **Code Examples**: We have added concise code snippets demonstrating the usage of algorithms, making it easier for users to understand their implementation.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions on how to contribute to the repository have been included, encouraging community involvement.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```
# DSA Questions
This repository contains various data structures and algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions

This repository contains a curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in various programming languages. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for students and developers to learn and practice DSA concepts.

## Directory Structure
- `/algorithms`: Contains implementations of various algorithms.
- `/data_structures`: Contains implementations of different data structures.
- `/tests`: Includes unit tests for validating the correctness of the algorithms.

## Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the binary search algorithm in Python:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example Call
result = binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README was significantly revised to improve clarity and organization. Ensure you follow the new guidelines when contributing.
- Some sections were removed to streamline the document; please refer to the updated sections for current practices.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```
4. Review the output for any failed tests or errors.
