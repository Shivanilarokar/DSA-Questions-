Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems categorized by type, with clear implementations in Python. It serves as a learning resource for those looking to enhance their understanding of algorithms.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems categorized by type, with clear implementations in Python. It serves as a learning resource for those looking to enhance their understanding of algorithms.

## Features
- A wide variety of DSA questions categorized by data structures and algorithms.
- Clear and concise implementations in Python.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of the Changes
In this latest update, the README.md file has been auto-updated to reflect the following changes:
- The title was simplified from **"DSA Questions Repository"** to **"DSA Questions"** for brevity and clarity.
- The emoji associated with the title was updated to better represent the repository's focus.
- Improved clarity in the description of the repository.
- Minor adjustments in the installation and usage instructions.
- Added an example of a DSA question in Python to demonstrate functionality.

    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd DSA-Questions-
    ```
3. Install any required dependencies.

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a DSA function in Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
