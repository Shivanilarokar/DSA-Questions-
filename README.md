## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, ideal for practice and interview preparation.

## Features
- A wide range of DSA problems categorized by difficulty.
- Code implementations in various programming languages.
- Contributions from the community to enhance the problem set.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the `README.md` file has been refined to enhance clarity and aesthetics. Key changes include:
- Title update for improved clarity.
- Minor formatting adjustments for better readability.
- Code snippet optimization for enhanced performance.

### Changes Made:
- Updated the repository title from `# DSA Questions Repository` to `# DSA Questions`.
- Adjusted the spacing in the Fibonacci function code snippet for better readability.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Explore the various algorithms and data structures by navigating through the folders in the repository. Each problem includes a description, constraints, and sample inputs/outputs.

## Example
Here‚Äôs a simple example of a function from the repository:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Returns the nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

This function computes the Fibonacci number for a given input `n`.

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute to enhancing the collection of DSA problems! üöÄ
