Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that help users sharpen their problem-solving skills. Each question is accompanied by a detailed solution to facilitate understanding and learning.

## Overview
The DSA Questions repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of DSA problems that are essential for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## Features
- A variety of DSA problems categorized by difficulty.
- Detailed solutions for each problem to aid learning.
- Easy navigation and organization for better usability.

## Summary of the Changes üìù
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Addition of a new **Features** section for improved organization.
- Updated the **Installation** section to facilitate easier setup.

### Example Code Snippet
Here's an improved example of a Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
