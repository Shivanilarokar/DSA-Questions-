Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to help you enhance your coding skills.

## Features
- A comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Solutions and explanations for each problem.
- A collaborative environment welcoming contributions from the community. ðŸŽ‰

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the `README.md` file has been improved to enhance informativeness and usability:

- **Clarified example usage** of the Fibonacci function for better understanding.
- **Modified wording** in the installation instructions for clarity.

### Code Snippet Example
Hereâ€™s a quick example of a Fibonacci function included in the repository:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Returns the nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 3
```
