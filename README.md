Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to enhance your coding skills through detailed implementations.

## Overview
The DSA Questions repository aims to help developers improve their coding skills through a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.

## Features
- A wide array of DSA problems with detailed implementations.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest commit, the `README.md` file has been updated to improve clarity and formatting. Key changes include:
- Enhanced clarity in the overview and features sections.
- Improved formatting of code snippets for better readability.
- Updated installation instructions for better guidance.

### Code Snippet Changes
Here's an example of how the code snippets were modified for clarity:

**Before:**
```python
def example_function():
    # Your code here
    pass
example_function()
```

**After:**
```python
# Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
def example_function():
    # Your implementation here
    pass
example_function()
```

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, clone the repository and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
To use the repository, navigate to the specific problem directory and run the associated scripts.

## Example
Here's a simple example of how to define a function for a DSA problem:

### Example usage of a DSA problem
```python
def example_function():
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```
