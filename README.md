# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository includes significant enhancements to the documentation and code examples contained within the README.md file. The primary goal of these changes is to improve clarity and usability for developers and contributors who are navigating the repository. By providing clearer explanations and more relevant examples, we aim to facilitate a better understanding of the data structures and algorithms presented here.

In addition to improving the documentation, we've also streamlined some of the existing code snippets to reflect best practices in coding standards. This not only aids in readability but also ensures that users can easily replicate and test the algorithms provided. With these enhancements, we hope to foster a more engaging and educational experience for all users interested in data structures and algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved explanations and context for various algorithms.
- **Updated Code Examples**: Refactored existing code snippets for better clarity and compliance with coding standards.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Ensured uniformity in the presentation of code blocks and descriptions throughout the README.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def reverse(arr):
    return arr[::-1]
```

**After:**
```python
def reverse(arr):
    """Reverses the given list."""
    return arr[::-1]
```
*The updated example includes a docstring, enhancing the understanding of the function's purpose.*
