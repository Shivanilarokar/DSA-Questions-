## Summary of Changes

This update to the `DSA-Questions` repository refines the documentation in the `README.md` file, enhancing clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The changes primarily focus on structuring the information more effectively, making it easier for new developers to navigate and understand the repository's purpose and usage.

Additionally, we have included improved code examples that demonstrate key functionalities of the data structures and algorithms covered in this repository. By providing concise before-and-after examples, we aim to illustrate the practical applications of the algorithms, thereby enriching the learning experience for users.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation Structure**: The README has been reorganized to facilitate easier navigation and comprehension.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Small code snippets have been added to showcase the functionality of various algorithms and data structures, making it easier for users to grasp their implementation.
- **Clarified Contribution Guidelines**: The contribution section has been updated to provide clearer instructions for developers wishing to contribute to the project.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before
```python
# Example of a simple sorting function
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```

#### After
```python
# Improved sorting function with example usage
def sort_array(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array in ascending order.
    
    :param arr: List of elements to be sorted
    :return: Sorted list of elements
    """
    return sorted(arr)

# Example usage:
numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1]
sorted_numbers = sort_array(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 8]
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing functionalities remain intact, and the changes are purely focused on improving documentation and code clarity.
