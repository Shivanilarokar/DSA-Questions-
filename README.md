## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Explore the various folders for different DSA problems and their respective solutions. Each problem includes sample inputs and outputs, along with the implementation details.

## Example
Here's a simple example of a binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
