You can navigate through the repository to find various DSA problems and their corresponding solutions.

### Example
Here is a specific implementation of the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
