Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- üìù **Structured example format for better understanding**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Added a dedicated **Features** section for better visibility.
- Improved the example code for the Fibonacci function, showcasing a more efficient iterative approach.
- Code snippet for a simple DSA question solution using the Fibonacci sequence has been updated for clarity and performance.

## Example
Here‚Äôs an example of a simple DSA question solution using the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute to enhancing the collection of DSA questions and solutions! Happy coding! üéâ
