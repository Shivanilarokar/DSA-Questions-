## Overview
This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions and their solutions. It serves as a resource for developers and students looking to enhance their understanding of DSA concepts through practical coding examples.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions
- Clear and concise solutions in Python
- Easy to navigate and contribute to
- Continuous updates and improvements

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we have made a small yet significant enhancement to the Fibonacci function. An `else` clause has been added for clarity in the recursive logic. This improvement enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.

### Code Changes
```python
# Example of a Fibonacci function
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:  # Added else clause for clarity
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```
Then navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
You can run the Python scripts to test the DSA questions and their solutions:
```bash
