# DSA Questions

Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project contains a collection of data structures and algorithms questions designed to help you improve your coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Contents
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms

### Example: Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```
