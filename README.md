Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a collection of data structures and algorithms questions along with their solutions. This repository offers a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms to help you enhance your coding skills. üìö

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python. The code is designed to be well-structured and easy to understand, making it a valuable resource for learners and developers alike.

## Features üéâ

- Extensive collection of data structures and algorithms
- Well-documented code examples
- Easy-to-follow implementations

## Summary of the Changes üìù

In the latest update, the following changes were made:

1. **Updated Header**: Enhanced the header for the "Summary of Changes" section for clarity.
2. **Removed Notebook File**: The `Day1.ipynb` file containing initial DSA questions and their explanations was removed.
3. **Improved Functionality**: 
   - Enhanced the `BankAccount` class in `function.py` to handle deposits and withdrawals more effectively.
   - Added a default balance parameter to the `BankAccount` constructor.
   - Included print statements to provide feedback on deposit and withdrawal actions.
   - Enhanced error handling for insufficient funds during withdrawals.

### Code Snippet

Here's a glimpse of the updated `BankAccount` class:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"{amount} deposited. New balance: ‚Çπ{self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds!")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"{amount} withdrawn. New balance: ‚Çπ{self.balance}")

    def show_balance(self):
        print(f"Account Balance for {self.owner}: ‚Çπ{self.balance}")
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Example Usage
acc = BankAccount("John Doe", 1000)
acc.deposit(500)
acc.withdraw(2000)
acc.show_balance()
```
