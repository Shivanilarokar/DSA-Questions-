### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions
Some text about data structures and algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data structure and algorithm questions designed to help users enhance their problem-solving skills.

## Examples
### Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes
- The previous README lacked structured sections, which may have led to confusion. The new format is designed to be more user-friendly and informative.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this update, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Open the `README.md` file in your preferred text editor to review the changes.

3. Ensure that all code snippets are correctly formatted and functional by testing them in your local Python environment.

4. Verify that the navigation and structure allow for easy understanding and access to different sections.

5. Optionally, run any existing tests to ensure that the core functionality remains intact:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
