# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the overall structure and clarity of the README file. The primary goal was to improve the documentation for developers and users alike, ensuring that the repository's purpose, usage, and contribution guidelines are easily accessible and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduced clearer examples and highlighted the importance of testing to maintain code quality.

The changes include a refined introduction, a detailed explanation of the features, and an organized section for contribution guidelines. We also provided small code snippets to demonstrate how to utilize various data structures and algorithms effectively. This update serves to make the repository more welcoming for newcomers and more efficient for contributors.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Introduction**: Clarified the purpose of the repository and what users can expect.
- **Improved Code Examples**: Added small, illustrative examples for better understanding.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clearly outlined the steps for contributing to the project.
- **Testing Instructions**: Included a dedicated section on how to test the implementation.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # implementation
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """Perform a binary search on a sorted array."""
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1  # Target not found
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update; existing functionality remains intact. However, the improved documentation may require users to update their understanding of how to interact with the repository.
