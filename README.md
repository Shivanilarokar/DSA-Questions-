## Overview
The **DSA Questions** repository provides a structured approach to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains a collection of common DSA problems and solutions, designed to help developers improve their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Well-structured code solutions
- Easy to understand and follow
- Contributions are welcome!

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the following changes were made to the `README.md` file:
- **Badges** were added to display repository size, contributors, and open issues.
- An **Overview** section was introduced to provide better context about the repository.
- The **Installation** and **Usage** sections were refined for clarity.
- An **Example Code Snippet** section was added to showcase a sample function from the repository.

## Installation 🛠️
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage 📚
Navigate to the desired directory and run the Python scripts to test the solutions.

### Example Code Snippet
Here’s a simple example of a function from the repository:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Returns the nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```
This function computes the Fibonacci number for a given input `n`.
