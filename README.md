# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant enhancements to the DSA Questions repository, focusing on improving the overall structure and clarity of the README file. The new documentation provides a clearer overview of the project, making it easier for contributors and users to navigate and understand the purpose and functionality of the codebase. Additionally, we have refined the examples provided to better illustrate the use of various data structure algorithms and their applications.

By organizing the README into more distinct sections, users can quickly find relevant information, such as installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines. This improved layout not only enhances the user experience but also encourages more developers to engage with the project and contribute their own solutions to the data structure and algorithm challenges presented.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Clarity:** The README now includes a clearer introduction and detailed explanations of the project's purpose and scope.
- **Structured Sections:** The document is organized into well-defined sections, including Installation, Usage, and Contribution Guidelines.
- **Enhanced Code Examples:** Code snippets have been updated for better readability and relevance, showcasing both before and after scenarios of algorithm implementations.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before

```python
# Old example of a sorting algorithm
def sort(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```

#### After

```python
# Improved example of a sorting algorithm with detailed comments
def sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using Python's built-in sorted function."""
    # Using sorted() returns a new sorted list
    return sorted(arr)

# Example usage
unsorted_array = [5, 3, 8, 1]
sorted_array = sort(unsorted_array)
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 8]
```

## Breaking Changes

No breaking changes were introduced in this update. All existing functionalities remain intact, ensuring backward compatibility for current users of the repository.
