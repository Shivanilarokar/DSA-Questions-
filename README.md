# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant enhancements to the `README.md` file of the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal of this change was to improve clarity and usability for developers and contributors. By restructuring sections and adding detailed examples, we aim to provide a more intuitive guide for navigating the repository and understanding its contents. 

The updated README now highlights key features and functionalities, making it easier for users to find the information they need quickly. Additionally, we have included before-and-after code snippets to illustrate the impact of recent code changes, ensuring that users can see practical applications of the algorithms and data structures discussed in the repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The overall layout of the README has been refined for better readability. Sections are now clearly delineated, making navigation straightforward.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Added before-and-after code snippets to demonstrate the functionality of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Clarity on Usage**: Detailed instructions on how to use the provided code snippets effectively.

### Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a basic linked list implementation
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        # Append logic here
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved linked list implementation with additional methods
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the linked list implementation has been altered to include a robust `append` method. Existing implementations may require adjustments to accommodate this new structure.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
3. Run the provided test suite to ensure all algorithms are functioning as expected:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```
4. Verify the output for any discrepancies and ensure all tests pass successfully.
