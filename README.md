This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions, along with solutions and code examples to facilitate learning and understanding.

## Overview
The DSA Questions repository contains a variety of coding problems and their solutions, primarily in Python. It is designed to help developers and students enhance their coding skills and understanding of DSA concepts.

## Features
- **Extensive Problem Set**: A wide range of DSA problems to practice and improve your skills.
- **Code Examples**: Clear and concise code examples in Python for easy understanding.
- **Community Contributions**: Contributions from the community are encouraged, making this repository a collaborative learning space.

## Summary of the Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è
Recent updates to the `README.md` file include:
- Updated the title emoji for better representation.
- Enhanced formatting of badges for improved visual appeal.
- Added a detailed implementation of the `two_sum` function, showcasing its logic.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, simply clone it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
You can navigate through the various folders to find specific DSA problems and their respective solutions. Here‚Äôs an example of how to use the `two_sum` function:

```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

**Function Implementation:**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in hashmap:
            return [hashmap[complement], i]
        hashmap[num] = i
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

## Example
Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to utilize the `two_sum` function:

```python
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1] since nums[0] + nums[1] equals target
```
