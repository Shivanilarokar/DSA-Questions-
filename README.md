# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary

In this update, we have enhanced the documentation of the DSA Questions repository to provide clearer instructions and examples for users. The README file now includes detailed sections that explain the purpose of the repository, how to navigate through the various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions, and the methodologies employed in solving them. This improvement aims to make it easier for new contributors and users to understand the project's scope and how they can effectively utilize it.

Additionally, we've added a section that highlights the structure of the codebase, making it more straightforward for users to find specific algorithms or data structures they are interested in. This change is particularly beneficial for those who are preparing for coding interviews or looking to improve their problem-solving skills in a structured manner.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now provides a comprehensive overview of the repository, outlining its purpose and the types of questions included.
- **Code Structure Explanation**: Added details on how the code is organized, making it easier to navigate.
- **Example Usage**: Included small code snippets demonstrating how to use the provided algorithms and data structures.

### Before and After
