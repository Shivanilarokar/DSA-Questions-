## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage üñ•Ô∏è
To use the solutions provided in this repository, navigate to the desired question's directory and execute the corresponding Python file.

### Example
Here‚Äôs an example of how to use one of the functions provided in this repository:

```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

def two_sum(nums, target):
    # Your implementation here
    pass

result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1] since nums[0] + nums[1] equals target
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
