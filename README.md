## Summary of Changes
This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the clarity and usability of the README file. The changes aim to provide new users with a better understanding of the project's purpose, structure, and how to contribute effectively. By streamlining the content and adding relevant examples, we hope to improve onboarding for developers interested in data structures and algorithms.

In addition to content improvements, we've also made adjustments to the formatting and organization of the README. This includes clearer section headings and an expanded "How to Test" section that provides step-by-step instructions for running tests. The goal of these changes is to create a more welcoming and informative environment for users who wish to explore DSA questions and solutions.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Added detailed explanations of the project's goals and structure.
- **Code Examples**: Provided small code snippets to illustrate key concepts.
- **Improved Test Instructions**: Clarified the testing process for better user experience.

## Summary
This repository contains a collection of data structure and algorithm questions aimed at helping developers improve their problem-solving skills. Each question comes with a solution and an explanation.

## Code Example
Here's a simple example of a binary search implementation:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes
- The structure of the README has been revised for clarity. While no functional changes were made to the codebase, the documentation updates may affect how new contributors navigate the project.

## How to Test
To test the changes made in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

This will execute all unit tests in the `tests` directory and provide feedback on the current state of the codebase.

```json
