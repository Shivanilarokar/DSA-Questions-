# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have enhanced the README file to provide clearer guidance and improve the overall aesthetic of the documentation. These changes aim to make it easier for developers to navigate the repository and understand the various data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions available. Additionally, we have included more detailed examples and explanations to facilitate quicker onboarding for new contributors.

The enhancements include a structured layout, improved formatting, and the addition of code snippets that demonstrate the usage of key algorithms. This will not only benefit current users but also attract new contributors who are looking for a well-documented resource for DSA questions.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: The README now includes a clear overview of the repository's purpose and how to get started.
- **Code Examples**: Small before/after code examples have been added to illustrate the functionality of key algorithms.
- **Enhanced Aesthetic**: Improved formatting and structure for better readability.

### Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example function
def example_function(arr):
    # Logic here
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
# Example function with improved documentation
def example_function(arr):
    """
    Processes the input array and returns the result.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): The input array of integers.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The processed array.
    """
    # Logic here
    return arr  # Placeholder for actual processing
```

## Breaking Changes

- None. The changes are primarily focused on improving documentation and do not affect the underlying codebase or functionality.
