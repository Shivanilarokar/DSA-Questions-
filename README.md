# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository focuses on enhancing the clarity and usability of the README file. The changes provide a more structured format, making it easier for contributors and users to navigate the content. We aim to improve the overall understanding of the project, its purpose, and how to contribute effectively. 

Additionally, we have added new sections that highlight key features, usage examples, and testing instructions. These updates are designed to streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and ensure that existing users have quick access to important information.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Structure**: The README has been reorganized into clear sections, including Summary, Highlights, Code Examples, Breaking Changes, and How to Test.
- **Code Examples**: Added small before-and-after code snippets to illustrate the usage of algorithms and data structures.
- **Testing Instructions**: Provided a detailed section on how to run tests to validate functionality and ensure code quality.

### Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```
This change improves type hinting, enhancing code readability and usability.

## Breaking Changes

- **Function Signatures**: Some function signatures have been updated to include type hints. This change may require existing code that uses these functions to be updated accordingly.
- **Directory Structure**: The organization of the project files has been modified to follow a more conventional structure. Please ensure that your local environment reflects this new structure.
