```

## Usage
Follow the instructions in the repository to explore various DSA problems and solutions. Each solution is accompanied by explanations and example code.

### Example
Here is a simple example of a Fibonacci function demonstrating recursion:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """This function calculates the Fibonacci number for a given `n`, demonstrating recursion."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```
This function calculates the Fibonacci number for a given `n`, demonstrating recursion.
