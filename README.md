```

## Usage
You can explore various DSA questions and their solutions within this repository. Below is an example of how to use the Fibonacci function implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

## Example
Here‚Äôs an example of the Fibonacci function implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
