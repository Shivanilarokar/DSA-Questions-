## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions along with their solutions to help you enhance your coding skills and understanding of DSA concepts.

## Features
- Comprehensive set of DSA questions.
- Clear and concise solutions in Python.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.
- Continuous updates and improvements.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we made a slight enhancement to the Fibonacci function, improving code clarity and organization. The changes include:
- Added an `else` clause for better readability in the Fibonacci function.
- Updated usage instructions for running the Python scripts.

### Code Changes
Here's a snippet of the updated code:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
