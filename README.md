# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository focuses on enhancing the clarity and usability of the README file. The improvements made aim to provide users and contributors with better guidance on navigating the repository, understanding its structure, and utilizing the available resources effectively. Key sections were added, and existing content was refined to ensure that users can easily find the information they need to maximize their experience with the project.

Additionally, this update introduces small code examples to better illustrate how users can implement various data structures and algorithms. These examples serve as practical references, allowing users to quickly grasp concepts and apply them in their own projects. By streamlining the documentation and incorporating more illustrative content, we hope to foster a more engaging and informative experience for both new and seasoned contributors.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes clearer sections on setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Small code snippets were added to demonstrate key algorithms and data structures.
- **Improved Formatting**: The overall layout and formatting of the README have been refined for better readability.

### Before and After Example

**Before:**
```markdown
## Usage
To use the algorithms, clone the repo.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Usage

To use the algorithms, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
```

### Example of a Simple Algorithm
Hereâ€™s a small example of how to implement a binary search:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Breaking Changes

- The previous structure of the README was simplified to eliminate redundancy. Users should refer to the new sections for the most up-to-date information.
- The code examples may differ slightly in syntax and structure from previous versions for clarity and consistency.

## How to Test
