# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
This update refines the documentation in the `README.md` file for the DSA Questions repository. The primary focus was to enhance clarity and usability, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the repository and understand the purpose of the project. Additionally, we have included more detailed instructions on how to contribute, along with usage examples for key algorithms.

The modifications aim to provide a structured overview of the data structures and algorithms (DSA) included in the repository. By presenting clearer examples and a more comprehensive guide, we hope to facilitate a better learning experience for developers and students alike. This change is particularly beneficial for newcomers to the field of algorithms and data structures, making it easier to grasp the concepts and apply them in practice.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced explanations and examples for various algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Added a section detailing how to contribute to the repository.
- **Usage Examples**: Included small code snippets to illustrate the implementation of algorithms.

### Before and After Examples

- Merge Sort
```

After:
```markdown
## Sorting Algorithms
### Quick Sort
```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
```
### Merge Sort
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    while left and right:
        if left[0] < right[0]:
            result.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            result.append(right.pop(0))
    result.extend(left or right)
    return result
```

## Breaking Changes
No breaking changes were introduced in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, ensuring backward compatibility with previous implementations.
