## Example
Here's a simple example of a Fibonacci function implemented in Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = fibonacci(n - 1)
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
