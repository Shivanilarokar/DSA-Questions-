**Description:** Given a linked list, reverse it.

**Solution:**
```python
class Node:

        self.value = value
        self.next = None

def reverse_linked_list(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next  # Store next node
        current.next = prev       # Reverse the link
        prev = current            # Move prev forward
        current = next_node       # Move current forward
    return prev  # New head of the reversed list
```
