## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms questions designed to help you practice and enhance your coding skills.

## Features
- Extensive collection of DSA questions.
- Community-driven contributions.
- Clear and concise explanations for each question.
- Code snippets for better understanding.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the following changes were made:
- Updated the README structure to include a dedicated "Overview" and "Features" section.
- Improved the code snippet for the Fibonacci function to enhance clarity and performance.

### Code Snippet Changes
Hereâ€™s an example of the updated Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Return a list of Fibonacci numbers up to n."""
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
To use the Fibonacci function, simply call it with the desired number as shown below:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
