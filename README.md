Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to enhance your coding skills through detailed implementations.

## Overview
The DSA Questions repository aims to help developers improve their coding skills by providing a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions.

## Features
- A wide array of DSA problems with detailed implementations.
- Clear explanations and structured code snippets for better understanding.
- Easy-to-follow installation and usage instructions.
- Contribution guidelines for easy navigation.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest commit, the `README.md` file has been updated to improve clarity and formatting. Key changes include:
- Enhanced clarity in the overview and features sections.
- Improved formatting of code snippets for better readability.
- Modified installation and usage instructions for clarity.

### Code Snippet Changes
Here's an example of how the code snippets were modified for clarity:

**Before:**
```python
def example_function():
    # Your code here
    pass
example_function()
```

**After:**
```diff
------- Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
------- ```python
---------def example_function():
---------    # Your code here
---------    pass
-------+-    example_function()
--------```
```

## Installation
To clone this repository, run:
```bash
