## Summary of Changes
In this update, we've enhanced the documentation within the README file to provide clearer guidance for contributors and users of the DSA Questions repository. The focus has been on improving the structure, adding detailed sections, and ensuring that all relevant information is easy to find. This will help new contributors understand the purpose of the repository and how to get involved more effectively.

Additionally, we have introduced small code examples that illustrate the usage of data structures and algorithms included in the repository. This change aims to provide practical insights into how the code can be applied, making it more accessible for users who may be unfamiliar with certain concepts.

## Highlights
- Improved README structure for better readability.
- Added code examples for key data structures and algorithms.
- Clarified contribution guidelines and testing instructions.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**

This repo contains various data structure and algorithm questions.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data structure and algorithm questions designed to enhance your coding skills.

## Code Example
Hereâ€™s how to implement a basic binary search:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes
There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing functionalities remain intact and fully operational.
