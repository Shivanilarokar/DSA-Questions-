## Data Structures

### Arrays
Arrays hold a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. They are commonly used for storing data that is accessed in a linear fashion.

#### Example:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(arr[0])  # Output: 1
```

### Linked Lists
Linked lists are collections of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. They are useful for dynamic memory allocation.

#### Example:
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```
```
