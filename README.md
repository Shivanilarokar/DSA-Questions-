Here's a sample code snippet for calculating Fibonacci numbers:

```python
# Example of a simple DSA question solution
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
