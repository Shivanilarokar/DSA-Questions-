# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces enhancements to the README.md file, providing clearer guidance on the project structure, usage, and contribution guidelines. The aim is to improve the onboarding experience for new contributors and users, ensuring they can navigate the repository effectively and understand its purpose and functionality.

In addition to the improved documentation, we have refined the code examples provided in the README to better illustrate common use cases and algorithms. This will help users grasp the practical applications of the data structures and algorithms covered in this repository. The overall goal is to enhance clarity, usability, and accessibility for all users.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes a more detailed project overview, installation instructions, and contribution guidelines.
- **Improved Code Examples**: Code snippets have been updated and expanded to provide clearer and more relevant examples of data structures and algorithms.
- **Formatting Updates**: Consistent Markdown formatting has been applied to improve readability.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```
This change includes type hints and a docstring, making the function clearer and more informative.

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing functionality remains intact and compatible with previous versions.

## How to Test

To ensure that everything is functioning as expected after the updates:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

3. Review the README for updated instructions and examples.

4. Run any existing unit tests to verify that the algorithms still work as intended:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

5. Optionally, try implementing any of the algorithms based on the updated examples to see how they perform in practice.
