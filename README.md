The aim is to improve user experience for developers and contributors alike, ensuring that anyone new to the repository can quickly understand its purpose and how to get started. The updates include a more structured overview of the project, clearer contribution guidelines, and improved formatting for readability.

Additionally, we have added sections that highlight the key features of the repository and provide concise examples to demonstrate usage. This will not only help developers understand the available functionalities but also encourage contributions by making it easier for them to get involved.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Project Overview**: The introduction now clearly outlines the purpose of the repository and its significance in the context of data structures and algorithms.
  
- **Contribution Guidelines**: A new section detailing how to contribute to the project has been added, making it easier for new contributors to understand the process.

- **Code Examples**: Added small before/after code snippets to illustrate how to implement specific data structure algorithms, enhancing clarity.

### Before and After Examples

**Before**:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After**:
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```
