```

Follow the instructions in the repository to explore various DSA problems and solutions.

### Example ðŸ’¡
Here's an example of a Fibonacci function implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """This function calculates the Fibonacci number for a given `n`, demonstrating recursion."""
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
