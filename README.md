- **Usage Examples**: Included practical code snippets to demonstrate how to use the provided data structures and algorithms.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**

```markdown
# DSA Questions
Some description of the project.
```

**After:**

```markdown
# DSA Questions

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms commonly asked in coding interviews.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
cd DSA-Questions
```

## Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes introduced in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, ensuring backward compatibility for users relying on previous versions.

## How to Test

To ensure that the changes are functioning as intended, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Open the README.md file and verify that all sections are clearly defined and all examples are correct.

3. Run any existing tests to confirm that the functionality of the algorithms is unchanged:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Review the usage examples by executing them in your local Python environment to ensure they perform as expected.
