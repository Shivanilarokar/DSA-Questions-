```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and start exploring the solutions.

## Usage
Explore the various DSA problems and their solutions available in this repository. You can contribute by adding more solutions or improving existing ones.

## Example
Here's a simple example of a Fibonacci function implemented in Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]

    fib_sequence = fibonacci(n - 1)
    fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence
```

Feel free to modify and enhance this function based on your understanding!
