- ### Example Code Snippet
  Here’s a revised example of a sorting algorithm usage:

  ```python
  # Example sorting algorithm usage
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
      return arr
  
  sample_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
  sorted_array = bubble_sort(sample_array)
  print("Sorted array is:", sorted_array)
  ```
