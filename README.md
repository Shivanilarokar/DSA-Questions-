## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

## Usage üöÄ
You can explore various data structures and algorithms by navigating through the provided questions and solutions in the repository. Feel free to run the examples and modify them to enhance your understanding.

## Example üìñ
To test the Fibonacci function, simply run the following code in your Python environment:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer"
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

print(fibonacci(0))  # Output: Input should be a positive integer
```

This function now includes handling for edge cases, ensuring robustness.
