## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant improvements to the `README.md` file, enhancing clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The main objective of these changes is to provide a more structured overview of the project, clearly outline the installation and usage instructions, and include additional examples to facilitate understanding. The revisions aim to create a welcoming environment for new contributors while maintaining the project's technical rigor.

Additionally, the README has been reformatted to improve readability and navigation. Key sections have been highlighted, and examples have been refined to better showcase the functionality of the data structures and algorithms implemented in this repository. This should help users quickly grasp the core concepts and get started with the codebase.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now contains clearer headings and subheadings, making it easier to navigate through sections.
- **Installation Instructions**: Added detailed steps for installation, ensuring that users can easily set up the project in their environment.
- **Code Examples**: Enhanced code snippets to illustrate the usage of various data structures and algorithms. These examples now include before and after scenarios to demonstrate functionality effectively.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Simple linked list implementation
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

**After:**
```python
# Linked List Implementation with Print Method
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def print_list(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")
```

## Breaking Changes

- **Method Rename**: The `display()` method in the `LinkedList` class has been renamed to `print_list()`. Ensure to update any references in your code accordingly.
- **Updated Example Formats**: Previous examples may have used different conventions. Users should refer to the new examples for the correct usage.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Verify the output against the expected results. You can also manually test the implementations by creating instances of the data structures and invoking their methods.

```json
{
  "summary_lines": [
    "This update enhances the README.md for better clarity and usability.",
    "It includes improved structure, installation instructions, and refined code examples."
  ],
  "important_files": [
    "README.md"
  ],
  "version_note": "Updated README to improve navigation and examples."
}
```
``` 

This README update effectively communicates the changes made, providing users and contributors with the necessary information to understand and engage with the project.
