## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
To clone this repository to your local machine, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage üìö
Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to implement the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
