This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions
- Detailed solutions and explanations
- Code examples to illustrate problem-solving techniques

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest commit, the `README.md` file has been updated to enhance clarity and usability:
- Improved the introduction for better readability.
- Refined the **Installation** and **Usage** sections to provide clearer instructions.
- Added a new **Example** section with a code snippet demonstrating a simple DSA question and solution.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and explore the various DSA questions and their solutions. You can run the code snippets in your local environment to test your understanding.

## Example
Here is a simple example demonstrating a DSA question and its solution:

```python
# Example Question: Find the maximum element in an array
def find_max(numbers):
    return max(numbers)

# Example Usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
