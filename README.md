### Example Question: Two Sum Problem
**Description**: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

**Code Snippet**:
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if target - num in num_map:
            return [num_map[target - num], i]
        num_map[num] = i
```
