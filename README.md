- Comprehensive list of coding problems categorized by data structures and algorithms.
- Clear problem statements with example solutions.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest commit, the `README.md` file has been updated to enhance clarity and organization. Key changes include:
- Added badges for GitHub stars and forks to increase visibility.
- Improved the features section to better describe the repository's offerings.
- Streamlined the installation and usage instructions for easier understanding.
- Enhanced example problem structure with clearer code snippets.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Navigate to the specific problem you want to solve and follow the instructions provided in the README of that problem.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a sample problem structure you might encounter:

**Description:** Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

**Example Usage:**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i

# Example Input
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]  # Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
```
