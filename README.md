## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository and installed any required dependencies, you can start exploring the DSA questions and solutions provided in the repository.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a DSA function in Python:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

## Example
Here is a simple example of a DSA question:
- **Problem**: Write a function to compute the nth Fibonacci number.
- **Input**: An integer `n`.
- **Output**: The nth Fibonacci number.
