This will help both new and experienced developers to quickly understand how to utilize the repository effectively.

Additionally, we have reorganized the content for better readability, ensuring that essential information is easy to find. The improved structure includes clear sections for features, code examples, and testing instructions, which will aid in onboarding contributors and users alike. 

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity and organization of the README.
- **Installation Instructions**: Added step-by-step guidance on how to set up the project.
- **Usage Examples**: Provided concise code snippets that demonstrate how to use key features of the repository.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Included clear instructions on how to run tests to verify functionality.

### Before and After Code Example

**Before**:  
The usage of the main algorithm was vaguely described.

```python
# Use the algorithm
result = algorithm(input_data)
```

**After**:  
The usage now includes context and a more descriptive example.

```python
# Example usage of the sorting algorithm
input_data = [5, 3, 8, 1]
sorted_data = sorting_algorithm(input_data)
print(f"Sorted Data: {sorted_data}")  # Output: Sorted Data: [1, 3, 5, 8]
```
