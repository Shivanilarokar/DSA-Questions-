# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the clarity and usability of the README file. The changes primarily focus on improving the documentation to better guide users on how to navigate the repository, understand the data structures and algorithms included, and contribute effectively. By refining the content, we aim to foster a more user-friendly experience for both new and experienced developers.

In addition to textual improvements, we have added examples that illustrate key data structures and algorithms. This will help users grasp the concepts more quickly and facilitate easier implementation in their own projects. Clear instructions on how to test the functionalities have also been included to ensure that users can validate their implementations seamlessly.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: The README has been restructured for better readability and flow.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets that demonstrate the use of key algorithms and data structures.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clear steps on how to run tests for the codebase have been included.

### Before/After Examples

**Before** (No examples provided):

```markdown
# DSA Questions
This repository contains various data structures and algorithms.
```

**After** (Examples added):

```markdown
# DSA Questions
This repository contains various data structures and algorithms.

## Example: Binary Search
Here's a simple implementation of binary search in Python:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has been modified, but there are no breaking changes to the codebase. Users should still find the existing algorithms and data structures function as expected.

## How to Test

To test the functionalities of the algorithms and data structures in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

Make sure all tests pass to ensure that the implementations are functioning correctly.
