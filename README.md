# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository primarily focuses on enhancing the documentation within the `README.md` file. By improving the clarity and structure of the content, we aim to provide better guidance for contributors and users alike. The changes include a more organized layout, additional sections to clarify usage, and updated examples to reflect the latest code implementations.

Furthermore, we've made an effort to streamline the instructions for testing and contributing to the repository. This is intended to lower the barrier for new contributors and ensure that existing users can easily navigate the repository's features and functionality.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: The `README.md` has been restructured for better readability, with clear headings and sections.
- **Updated Code Examples**: Code snippets have been revised to reflect the latest algorithm implementations, showcasing practical use cases.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to test the code has been added, making it easier for contributors to validate their changes.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

**After:**
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input should be a non-negative integer.")
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```

## Breaking Changes

- The `fibonacci` function has been modified to raise a `ValueError` for negative inputs, improving error handling and user feedback.
- The implementation now uses an iterative approach, which is more efficient than the previous recursive method.

## How to Test

To test the changes in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Execute specific functions to validate changes:
   ```python
   from dsa import fibonacci

   print(fibonacci(10))  # Expected output: 55
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that all functionalities work as expected and that the latest changes have not introduced any regressions.
