# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces several enhancements to the `README.md` file, aiming to improve clarity and usability for users and contributors. The changes focus on providing a more structured overview of the project, including a clearer summary, highlights of key features, and concise examples. This will help both newcomers and experienced developers quickly understand the purpose of the repository and how to navigate it effectively.

Additionally, we have refined the formatting and organization of the content to ensure a more aesthetically pleasing and easily readable document. This includes improved headings and bullet points for quick reference. By making these adjustments, we hope to foster greater community engagement and streamline the onboarding process for new contributors.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Summary**: The project summary has been rewritten to convey the purpose and scope of the DSA Questions repository more effectively.
- **Key Features**: A new section has been added to highlight the main features and functionalities of the repository.
- **Code Examples**: Small before/after code snippets have been included to demonstrate usage and clarify the implementation of key algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section outlining how to run tests has been included to facilitate contributions and ensure code quality.

### Before/After Code Examples

#### Before

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

#### After

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example Usage
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```

## Breaking Changes

- The `fibonacci` function now raises a `ValueError` for negative inputs, improving error handling and user feedback.

## How to Test

To ensure that all changes function correctly, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
