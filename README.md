## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) questions with solutions in multiple programming languages. It is designed to be easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Features âœ¨
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions.
- Solutions provided in multiple programming languages.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of the Changes ðŸ’„
In this update, the `README.md` has been enhanced to provide clearer instructions and examples for users. Key changes include:
- Added an **Overview** section to better describe the repository's purpose.
- Improved **Usage** instructions for navigating the repository.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
cd DSA-Questions-
ls
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and start exploring the DSA questions.

## Example
Here's a simple example of a Fibonacci function implemented in Python:

```python
# Example of a DSA solution in Python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_seq = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_seq.append(fib_seq[i-1] + fib_seq[i-2])
        return fib_seq

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
