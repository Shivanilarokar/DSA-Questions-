Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- ü§ñ **User-friendly structure for easy navigation**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide additional guidance on the Fibonacci function. The changes include:
- Improved phrasing in the installation instructions for better clarity.
- Added an example demonstrating how to use the Fibonacci function.

### Code Snippet of the Fibonacci Function
Here is a snippet showing the changes made:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example Usage
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```
