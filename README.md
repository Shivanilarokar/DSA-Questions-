Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md has been enhanced for better clarity and organization. Here are the key changes made:
- Added a **Features** section for better visibility of repository capabilities.
- Included an **Example** section to demonstrate a simple DSA implementation.
- Cleaned up code snippets for improved readability.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository and install any dependencies (if necessary):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
# Install dependencies (if any)
```

## Usage
Explore the collection of DSA questions and solutions. Feel free to contribute by submitting your own questions and solutions!

### Example
Here is a simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in Python:

```python
# Example of a simple DSA implementation
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1  # Target not found
```

We encourage you to explore the repository and contribute to the growing collection of DSA questions and solutions!
