# Project Title

A brief description of your project goes here. This project provides a set of tools for developers to streamline their workflows. It includes functions for data processing, API interaction, and more.

## What's New
- Added two new functions:
  - **`process_data(input_list: List[int]) -> int`**: Processes a list of integers and returns a single integer result.
  - **`fetch_data(url: str) -> dict`**: Fetches JSON data from a given URL and returns it as a dictionary.
- Removed deprecated functions that were no longer needed. The `old_function` was replaced by `process_data`.

## New Functions
- **`process_data(input_list: List[int]) -> int`**
  - Processes a list of integers and returns a single integer result.
  
  **Parameters:**
  - `input_list`: A list of integers to be processed.
  
  **Returns:**
  - An integer result based on the input list.
  
  **Usage Example:**
  ```python
  result = process_data([1, 2, 3])
  print(result)  # Output will depend on the implementation of process_data
  ```

- **`fetch_data(url: str) -> dict`**
  - Fetches JSON data from the specified URL and returns it as a dictionary.

  **Parameters:**
  - `url`: The URL from which to fetch the JSON data.

  **Returns:**
  - A dictionary containing the JSON data fetched from the specified URL.
  
  **Usage Example:**
  ```python
  data = fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data")
  print(data)  # Output will be the JSON data fetched from the specified endpoint
  ```
