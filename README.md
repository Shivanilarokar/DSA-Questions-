## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant enhancements to the DSA-Questions repository, focusing on improving the clarity and usability of the README file. The primary aim is to provide new contributors and users with a more structured and informative guide that outlines the purpose of the repository, the types of data structures and algorithms covered, and how to effectively engage with the content.

Additionally, we have refined the code examples, ensuring they are concise and illustrative of the core concepts. This revision not only makes it easier for users to grasp the material but also encourages active participation in the open-source community by simplifying the onboarding process for new contributors.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The README now features clear sections that delineate the purpose, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Code snippets have been updated for clarity, showcasing before and after scenarios to highlight the improvements made.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions on how to contribute to the repository have been added, facilitating easier collaboration.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a+b
```

**After:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```

This change improves code readability and includes type hints, which can help users understand the expected data types.

## Breaking Changes

- Code examples have been updated to include type hints, which may require users to adjust their understanding of expected input and output types in the functions.
- The structure of the README has been modified; users relying on the previous format may need to familiarize themselves with the new layout.
