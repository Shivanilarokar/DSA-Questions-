# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces several enhancements to the README file, ensuring better clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The changes aim to provide a more structured overview of the project, outline its purpose, and offer clear instructions for testing and contribution. By refining the documentation, we hope to facilitate a smoother onboarding experience for new developers and improve overall project engagement.

Key highlights of this update include a clearer section on project highlights, improved examples for better comprehension, and a dedicated section for breaking changes. These enhancements make it easier for users to navigate the repository and understand the core functionalities of the data structures and algorithms presented.

## Highlights

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity in project objectives and instructions.
- **Code Examples**: More illustrative examples demonstrating the usage of algorithms.
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearer communication regarding any breaking changes introduced in recent commits.

## Changes Made

- **Enhanced Summary**: The project summary has been expanded to give better context on the purpose and scope of the repository.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise before-and-after code snippets for better understanding of algorithm implementations.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: Introduced a dedicated section to outline any breaking changes in the project.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Quick sort implementation
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved quick sort implementation with additional logging
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    print(f"Pivot chosen: {pivot}")
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
```

## Breaking Changes

- The quicksort function now includes logging to track the pivot selection process, which may affect output if not handled properly in existing implementations.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite to ensure all algorithms function correctly:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

4. Manually test the modified quicksort function by running:
   ```python
   print(quicksort([3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]))
   ```
