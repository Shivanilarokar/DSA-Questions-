## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the documentation of the DSA Questions repository by providing clearer explanations and examples for the various data structures and algorithms covered. The README.md file has been revised to ensure that both new and experienced developers can easily navigate through the repository and understand how to utilize the code effectively. The changes aim to improve the overall user experience and provide quick references for common data structures and their implementations.

Additionally, we have streamlined the examples provided in the README, ensuring they are concise and directly relevant to the topics discussed. This includes adding before-and-after code snippets that illustrate the improvements made in the examples section. These changes not only enhance readability but also serve as practical guides for users looking to implement these algorithms and data structures in their own projects.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced explanations for each data structure and algorithm.
- **Code Examples**: Streamlined and simplified code examples for better understanding.
- **Readability**: Improved formatting and structure for easier navigation.

### Before/After Code Example

**Before:**
```python
# Function to reverse a string
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
```

**After:**
```python
# Function to reverse a string using slicing
def reverse_string(s: str) -> str:
    """Reverses the input string."""
    return s[::-1]
```
