```

Then, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage

You can use the provided implementations by importing the respective classes or functions into your own Python scripts. Here‚Äôs an example of how to use the `BankAccount` class:

### Example Usage

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        self.balance -= amount

    def show_balance(self):
        print(f"Account Balance for {self.owner}: ‚Çπ{self.balance}")

# Example of using the class
acc = BankAccount("Shivani", 5000)
acc.deposit(1000)
acc.withdraw(2000)
acc.show_balance()
```
