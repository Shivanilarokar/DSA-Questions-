## Usage 📖
Here’s an example of how to approach a DSA question:

### Example Question: Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

**Input:**
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

**Output:**
```python
[0, 1]  # Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
```

### Example Function
```python
def example_function():
    # Example solution code
    print("This is an example function.")
```
