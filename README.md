Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions
- Detailed solutions and explanations
- User-friendly structure for easy navigation

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and engagement. Key changes include:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight the benefits of the repository.
- Updated the example description for the Fibonacci function to specify that it is implemented in Python.
- Streamlined the closing remarks to encourage exploration and contributions.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
To use the repository effectively, refer to the provided examples and solutions for various DSA questions.

### Example: Fibonacci Function
Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the Fibonacci function in Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute to the collection of DSA questions and solutions. Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
