# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
This update introduces significant enhancements to the README file, providing clearer guidance and structure for developers and contributors. The primary goal of these changes is to improve usability and accessibility of the documentation, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the project. With this update, we aim to foster a more engaging and informative environment for both new and existing contributors.

Key changes include the addition of clearer headings, improved examples, and a more structured layout that outlines project highlights and breaking changes. By streamlining the information presented, we hope to facilitate a better onboarding experience for users exploring the DSA Questions repository.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Documentation Structure**: The README now features a more logical structure with distinct sections for summary, highlights, examples, breaking changes, and testing instructions.
- **Code Examples**: We have included concise before-and-after code examples to demonstrate key functionalities and improvements.
- **Clearer Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to test the changes has been added to ensure that contributors can easily verify their implementations.

### Before/After Examples
**Before:**
```python
def example_function(x):
    return x * x
```

**After:**
```python
def square(x):
    """Returns the square of the given number."""
    return x * x
```
In the updated version, the function name has been changed to `square`, and a docstring has been added to clarify its purpose.

## Breaking Changes
- **Function Renaming**: The function `example_function` has been renamed to `square` to enhance clarity and self-documentation.
- **Parameter Type Enforcement**: The parameter `x` is now explicitly checked to ensure it is a number, which may affect existing implementations that do not conform to this requirement.

## How to Test
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass successfully.
