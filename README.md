The changes aim to simplify the onboarding process for new contributors and users by offering a more structured overview of the project's objectives, usage, and contribution guidelines. Improved formatting and concise language make it easier to navigate the documentation and understand the key components of the repository.

Additionally, we've added sections that outline the core features of the project, as well as usage examples that illustrate how to implement various data structure and algorithm solutions. These enhancements are crucial for anyone looking to engage with the repository, whether they are students, educators, or software engineers seeking to sharpen their skills in data structures and algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README is now organized into clear sections, including an overview, features, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise code snippets demonstrating the implementation of selected algorithms.
- **Clarified Contribution Guidelines**: Updated instructions on how to contribute to the project, ensuring clarity for potential contributors.

### Code Examples

**Before:**
```plaintext
To use the algorithms, clone the repo and run the desired script.
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Usage

Clone the repository and navigate to the desired algorithm directory. For example, to run the binary search algorithm:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
cd DSA-Questions/binary_search
python binary_search.py
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has been significantly altered, which may affect how users reference the documentation. Ensure to familiarize yourself with the new layout.
- Old code snippets have been replaced with updated examples. Users should check the latest implementations for accuracy and performance improvements.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory of a specific algorithm:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions/algorithm_directory
   ```
3. Run the test cases to verify functionality:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

Ensure that all tests pass successfully. If you encounter any issues, please report them in the Issues section of the repository.
