Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository contains various problems and solutions related to data structures and algorithms, designed to help developers enhance their problem-solving skills and understanding of DSA concepts.

## Overview üåü

The DSA Questions repository offers a comprehensive collection of questions covering various data structures and algorithms. This repository is ideal for both interview preparation and skill enhancement.

## Features ‚ú®
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Detailed solutions implemented in Python
- Examples to illustrate each algorithm's functionality

## Summary of the Changes üìù

In the latest commit, the following updates were made to the README.md file:

- Improved the introductory text for clarity and conciseness.
- Updated the installation instructions for better usability.
- Enhanced the example code snippet for the Fibonacci function, including edge case handling.

### Here are some snippets from the updated README.md:

#### Installation
To clone the repository, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

#### Example Code Snippet
Here is an example of a Fibonacci function implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer"
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```
This function now includes handling for edge cases, ensuring robustness.
