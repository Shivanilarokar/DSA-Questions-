# DSA-Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA-Questions repository introduces significant enhancements to the README file, improving clarity and usability for developers and users alike. The primary aim of these modifications is to provide a more comprehensive overview of the project, including clearer instructions, improved formatting, and enhanced examples. By streamlining the information presented, users can more easily navigate the repository and utilize the data structures and algorithms effectively.

Additionally, the updated README emphasizes best practices for contributing to the project and includes a dedicated section on testing. This ensures that new contributors can quickly understand how to engage with the codebase, while also providing clear guidelines for maintaining code quality. As a result, the repository is now more accessible to both beginners and seasoned developers looking to sharpen their problem-solving skills in data structures and algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README has been reorganized for better flow and readability, including distinct sections for installation, usage, contribution guidelines, and testing.
- **Enhanced Examples**: New code snippets have been added to demonstrate specific data structures and algorithms, providing practical insights into their implementation.
- **Testing Instructions**: A clear "How to Test" section has been included to guide users on verifying their implementations and ensuring code correctness.

### Example: Before and After

**Before:**

## Usage

### Example: Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
This function performs a binary search on a sorted array.
```
