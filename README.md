Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to help you enhance your coding skills. 

## Features
- A comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Solutions and explanations for each problem.
- Easy navigation and clear instructions for users.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide better guidance for users:
- Added a new section highlighting features of the repository.
- Improved the instructions for cloning and navigating the repository.
- Updated the example solution for the Fibonacci sequence problem to be more comprehensive.
- Enhanced overall readability and structure of the README.

## Installation
To get started with the repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```

You can then explore the various DSA problems and their solutions.

Hereâ€™s a sample solution for the Fibonacci sequence problem:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Outputs: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
