git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage 📖
To use the various DSA questions and solutions available in this repository, navigate through the provided code snippets. For example, here’s a snippet of how the Fibonacci function is structured:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
