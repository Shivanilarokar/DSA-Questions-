# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
This update enhances the clarity and usability of the README file for the DSA Questions repository. It aims to provide a more structured overview of the project, making it easier for contributors and users to navigate the content and understand the purpose of the repository. The revised README now includes a clearer project description, highlights of features, and refined sections for code examples and testing instructions.

In addition to improving the overall readability, this update addresses some previously unclear instructions and adds examples that demonstrate the implementation of common data structures and algorithms. This will not only assist new contributors in understanding how to utilize the repository effectively but also serve as a quick reference for experienced developers.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Project Description**: The introduction has been restructured to clearly articulate the goals of the repository.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: New code snippets have been added to illustrate the implementation of key algorithms and data structures.
- **Refined Testing Instructions**: The testing section has been expanded to provide step-by-step guidance on how to ensure the functionality of the code.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example function
def example_function():
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
# Example function demonstrating a simple algorithm
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_seq = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
        return fib_seq
```

## Breaking Changes
- The API for the `fibonacci` function has been changed to improve its usability. It now returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to `n`, rather than a single number. Ensure that any existing code using this function is updated accordingly.

## How to Test
To test the functionality of the DSA Questions repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Verify that all tests pass and that the output matches expected results.

5. Optionally, run specific examples to ensure that they work as intended:
   ```python
   print(fibonacci(10))  # Output should be [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
   ```
