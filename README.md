## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant enhancements to the DSA Questions repository, focusing on improving the clarity and usability of the README file. The changes aim to provide a more structured overview of the project, making it easier for newcomers to understand the purpose and functionality of the repository. We have added detailed sections that outline the features, code examples, and testing instructions, ensuring a smoother onboarding experience for contributors and users alike.

In addition, we have refined the formatting and organization of the README to improve readability. These updates not only make it easier for users to navigate through the documentation but also highlight critical information more effectively. The goal is to foster a collaborative environment by encouraging contributions and facilitating a better understanding of data structures and algorithms through practical examples.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes a clear summary, features, code examples, and a structured testing guide.
- **Improved Code Examples**: Added before/after code snippets to demonstrate improvements and usage of the DSA Questions.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to run tests has been included to streamline the contribution process.

### Example Code Snippets

#### Before:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

#### After:
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```
The updated code example now includes type annotations and a docstring, enhancing code clarity and usability.
