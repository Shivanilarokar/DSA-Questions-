In this update to the DSA Questions repository, we have enhanced the README file to provide clearer guidance and improved documentation for users and contributors. The modifications include a refined structure, additional examples, and clearer explanations of the existing content. This makes it easier for newcomers to understand the purpose of the repository and how to effectively utilize it.

Furthermore, we have added a section that outlines the steps for testing the code, which is crucial for contributors who want to ensure their changes are functioning as expected. By improving the README, we aim to foster a more welcoming environment for contributors and users alike, thereby enhancing community engagement.

## Highlights of the Changes
- **Improved Documentation**: The README now contains a more organized structure with dedicated sections for an overview, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to illustrate how to implement various data structures and algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: A new section has been introduced to guide users on how to run tests effectively.

### Before and After Examples

## Breaking Changes
- The structure of the README has been significantly altered to improve readability. Users may need to adjust to the new format, but the content remains intact.
- The testing procedures have been standardized, which may require updates to any existing local scripts that were relying on older methodologies.

## How to Test
To run the tests for the current implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

Make sure that all tests pass before submitting any contributions to ensure code quality and integrity.
