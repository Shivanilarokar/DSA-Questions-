Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- üìù **User-friendly interface for learning**

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the `README.md` file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide additional information. Key changes include:

- Added a **Features** section to highlight the repository's offerings.
- Updated the cloning command to include the `.git` suffix for clarity.
- Improved the example of the Fibonacci function, raising a `ValueError` for negative inputs.
- Included an **Example usage** section for better understanding.

## Installation
To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage
You can navigate through the repository to find various DSA questions and their corresponding solutions. Here‚Äôs an example of how to use the Fibonacci function:

```python
# Sample Python function to demonstrate a DSA question
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input cannot be negative")
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
