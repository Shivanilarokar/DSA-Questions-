## Installation 🛠️
To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage 📚
Here’s an example of how to approach a DSA question:

### Example Question: Two Sum
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

**Input:**
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

**Function Implementation:**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    # Implementation goes here...
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

Feel free to explore the repository, practice the problems, and contribute your solutions!
