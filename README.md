# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant enhancements to the `README.md` file of the DSA Questions repository. The primary objective of these changes is to improve the documentation clarity, providing a better onboarding experience for new contributors and users. By restructuring sections and adding relevant examples, we aim to facilitate a deeper understanding of the data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions available within this repository.

Additionally, we have standardized the formatting and included a clear guide on how to test the repository. This should help users quickly navigate through the codebase and effectively contribute to the project. With these updates, we believe that users will find it easier to understand the purpose of the repository and how to utilize the provided resources.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity in the `README.md`, making it easier for users to understand the purpose of the repository and how to get started.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to demonstrate how to implement some of the DSA questions.
- **Testing Instructions**: Included a dedicated section on how to run tests and validate the functionality of the code.

### Code Example Before and After

**Before:**

```markdown
## Some DSA Questions
1. Reverse a string
2. Find the maximum element in an array
```

**After:**

```markdown
## DSA Questions

### 1. Reverse a String
To reverse a string in Python, you can use the following function:

```python
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
```

### 2. Find the Maximum Element in an Array
Here's how to find the maximum element in an array:

```python
def find_max(arr):
    return max(arr)
```
```
