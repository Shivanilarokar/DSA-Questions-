Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems aimed at helping developers enhance their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Overview
The DSA Questions repository aims to help developers improve their coding skills and understanding of fundamental concepts through a comprehensive collection of DSA problems.

## Features
- Extensive collection of DSA problems
- Well-documented problem statements and solutions
- Easy to navigate repository structure

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the `README.md` file has been streamlined to enhance clarity and conciseness. The following changes were made:
- Updated the repository title for clarity.
- Improved the introductory text to be more engaging.
- Removed redundant examples and streamlined code snippets for better readability.
- Clarified the usage section to emphasize the detailed implementations in individual problem files.
- Added a friendly invitation for contributions.

### Code Snippet Changes
Here's an example of how the code snippets were modified for clarity:

**Before:**
```diff
- Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
- ```python
---def example_function():
---    # Your code here
---    pass
-+-    def example_function():
-+-        # Your code here
-+-        pass
---example_function()
-+-    example_function()
--```
```

**After:**
```diff
+-    def example_function():
+-        # Your code here
+-        pass
++    example_function()
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

Then navigate into the directory:
```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```

Feel free to explore the various DSA problems available in this repository. Each problem file contains detailed implementations to help you understand the concepts better.

## Example
While specific code examples have been removed from the README for conciseness, you can find detailed implementations within the respective problem files in the repository.
