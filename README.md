## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant improvements to the README file for the DSA-Questions repository. The primary goal of these changes is to enhance clarity and provide better guidance for users and contributors. We have streamlined the documentation to make it easier for newcomers to understand the purpose of the project and how they can contribute effectively. Additionally, we've included more detailed sections on the structure of the repository and how to run tests.

### Highlights of Changes

1. **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes a clear explanation of what DSA-Questions is, along with its objectives. This helps users quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of the repository.
2. **Code Examples**: We have added small code snippets to demonstrate how to use the data structures and algorithms provided in the repository. This will assist users in understanding how to implement the solutions in their own projects.
3. **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to run tests has been introduced, ensuring that contributors can easily verify their changes and maintain code quality.
