```

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the desired problem directory and follow the instructions provided.

### Example
Here is a simple example demonstrating a Fibonacci sequence solution in Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```
