The DSA Questions repository aims to help developers improve their coding skills through a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems with detailed implementations. 

## Features
- A wide array of DSA problems with detailed implementations.
- Clear and concise explanations for each problem.
- Code snippets showcasing various algorithms and data structures.
- Easy navigation and contribution guidelines.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest commit, the `README.md` file has been updated to improve clarity and provide a better structure. Key modifications include:
- Enhanced introduction to the repository.
- Improved formatting and clarity in code examples.
- Minor adjustments to installation instructions for greater accuracy.

### Changed Code Snippets
Here's an example of how the code snippets were modified for clarity:

**Before:**
```diff
--- Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
--- ```python
-----def example_function():
-----    # Your code here
-----    pass
---+-    example_function()
----```
```

**After:**
```diff
--- Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
--- ```python
++++---def example_function():
++++---    # Your code here
++++---    pass
++++++    example_function()
--- ``` 
```
