# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README file of the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal of these changes is to enhance clarity and usability for developers engaging with the project. By providing clearer instructions and examples, we aim to facilitate a better understanding of the data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions available in this repository.

The updated README now includes detailed sections highlighting the most important features, usage instructions, and a concise overview of the repository's structure. This will help both new and experienced developers navigate the project more efficiently and find the information they need quickly.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Clarity**: Revised language to ensure that instructions are straightforward and easy to follow.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Added small code snippets demonstrating the usage of key functions and algorithms.
- **Structured Sections**: Organized content into clearly defined sections for easier navigation.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
## Usage
You can use the algorithms in your projects.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Usage Instructions

To utilize any algorithm, import the respective function from the module. For example, to use the binary search algorithm:

```python
from dsa_algorithms import binary_search

result = binary_search(sorted_list, target_value)
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function names have been standardized to follow the `snake_case` convention for better readability. Ensure that any existing code using previous function names is updated accordingly.
- The structure of the project has been modified to include a dedicated `examples/` directory for sample use cases.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Verify that all tests pass and review the output for any discrepancies.

Feel free to explore the examples provided in the `examples/` directory to see the algorithms in action!
