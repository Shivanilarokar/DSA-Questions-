## Usage 📖

Here’s an example of how to use the bubble sort function included in this repository:

```python
# Example usage of a sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example array
example_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_array = bubble_sort(example_array)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_array)
```
