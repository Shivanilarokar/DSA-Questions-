Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for practicing and enhancing your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of DSA questions along with their solutions, aiming to help developers improve their coding abilities and problem-solving skills.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions.
- Detailed solutions and explanations.
- Example code snippets for better understanding.

## Summary of the Changes üìù
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Addition of a new **Features** section for improved organization.
- Updated the **Installation** section to facilitate easier setup.
- Improved code snippet for a simple DSA question solution using the Fibonacci sequence for better clarity and performance.

### Example Code Snippet
Here's an improved example of a Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
