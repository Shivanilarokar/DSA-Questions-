# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README.md file to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. Our goal is to provide a more structured and informative guide that not only outlines the purpose of the repository but also details the various data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions available. This will help users navigate the repository more effectively and understand how to contribute.

The README now includes clear sections that highlight the key features of the repository, as well as a comprehensive overview of the changes made. We have also added small code examples to illustrate how to utilize specific algorithms and data structures, making it easier for users to grasp the concepts being discussed. 

## Highlights of the Changes
- **Improved Structure**: The README is now organized into distinct sections, including an overview, features, examples, and a contribution guide.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to demonstrate the usage of various algorithms and data structures.
- **Clearer Contribution Guidelines**: Enhanced instructions for contributing to the repository, making it easier for new contributors to get involved.
