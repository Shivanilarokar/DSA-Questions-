## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README.md file to enhance clarity and usability for users. The primary goal was to provide a more structured overview of the project, including a better explanation of its purpose, usage guidelines, and how to contribute. This change aims to make it easier for new contributors to understand the repository and for existing contributors to quickly find relevant information.

Additionally, we've included small code examples demonstrating how to use various data structures and algorithms implemented in the repository. This will help users grasp the practical applications of the code and encourage them to explore the repository further. Furthermore, we have refined the formatting and organization of the README to improve readability and aesthetics.

## Highlights of the Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now has clearly defined sections, making it easier for users to navigate through the content.
- **Code Examples**: Added practical examples for key data structures and algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Provided clearer instructions on how to contribute to the project.
- **Testing Instructions**: Detailed steps on how to test the changes locally.

### Code Example Before and After

**Before:**

```markdown
This repo contains DSA questions.
```

**After:**

```markdown
# DSA Questions Repository

This repository provides a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions aimed at helping developers enhance their coding skills.

## Example Usage

### Binary Search

Hereâ€™s how to implement a binary search algorithm in Python:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, and the new structure is designed to be additive, enhancing the user experience without disrupting existing workflows.
