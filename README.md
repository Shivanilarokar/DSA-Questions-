# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository includes enhancements to the README.md file, aimed at providing clearer guidance and improving user experience. The changes are focused on better structuring the documentation, enhancing clarity, and making it easier for contributors and users to navigate the repository. By providing a more comprehensive overview and examples, we aim to facilitate a smoother onboarding process for new users and contributors alike.

In addition to structural improvements, we have also included updated code examples that reflect best practices for data structures and algorithms (DSA). These changes are designed to help users understand how to implement various algorithms more effectively, thereby enriching their learning experience. 

## Highlights

- Improved README structure for better navigation.
- Added clear, concise examples of DSA implementations.
- Enhanced explanations for various sections to better support users.

### Small Code Examples

Here are some before and after examples of code snippets that have been included in the README:

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Adds two integers and returns the result.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first integer.
    b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the two integers.
    """
    return a + b
```
