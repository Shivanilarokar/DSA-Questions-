## Algorithms

### Sorting
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
  
  ```python
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
      return arr
  ```

### Searching
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays.
  
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while left <= right:
          mid = left + (right - left) // 2
          if arr[mid] == target:
              return mid
          elif arr[mid] < target:
              left = mid + 1
          else:
              right = mid - 1
      return -1
  ```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has changed, which may affect users who rely on previous formatting to locate specific sections. Please refer to the updated sections for accurate information.
- Any references to previous examples or sections may now be outdated; ensure you review the changes for the latest information.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
