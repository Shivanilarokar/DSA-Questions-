Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- üîß **Streamlined usage instructions for easy exploration and contribution**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest commit, the README.md file has been updated to enhance clarity and user experience. Key changes include:
- Added a dedicated section for **Features** to highlight the repository's strengths.
- Revised installation instructions for clarity:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
  ```
- Enhanced the **Usage** section to specify the structure of questions and solutions.
- Introduced an **Example** section showcasing a simple algorithm in Python:
  ```python
  def example_algorithm(data):
      # Process the data
      processed_data = [x * 2 for x in data]
      return processed_data
  ```
