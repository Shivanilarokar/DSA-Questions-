# DSA-Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README file of the DSA-Questions repository. The goal of these changes is to enhance the clarity and usability of the documentation, making it easier for both new and existing contributors to navigate and understand the project. This includes updates to the structure, content organization, and the inclusion of more illustrative examples.

The revisions also address feedback from the community regarding the need for clearer explanations of the data structures and algorithms covered in the repository. By implementing these changes, we aim to foster a more engaging and informative experience for users looking to deepen their understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Highlights of the Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now follows a more logical flow, with sections clearly delineated for easy navigation.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Weâ€™ve added concise before-and-after examples to demonstrate how different algorithms can be implemented.
- **Clarified Instructions**: Instructions for testing the code have been made clearer, ensuring users can easily verify functionality.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of a and b."""
    return a + b

# Example usage:
result = add(3, 4)  # result will be 7
```
