## Summary of Changes
This update to the README.md file enhances the documentation for the DSA-Questions repository, providing clearer instructions and examples for contributors and users alike. The goal of these changes is to improve the overall usability of the repository, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the available data structures and algorithms questions. By adding detailed explanations and examples, we aim to foster a better understanding of how to utilize the repository effectively.

Additionally, the updated README introduces a new section that highlights recent changes in the repository, allowing users to quickly identify modifications and enhancements. This will help both new and existing contributors stay informed about the project's evolution and maintain alignment with its goals.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Structure**: The README has been restructured for better readability, with a clear hierarchy of sections.
- **Example Enhancements**: Added more code examples to illustrate how to approach specific DSA questions.
- **Change Log**: Introduced a section to document breaking changes and important updates for user awareness.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
## Questions
- Binary Search
- Sorting Algorithms
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Questions
- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while low <= high:
          mid = (low + high) // 2
          if arr[mid] < target:
              low = mid + 1
          elif arr[mid] > target:
              high = mid - 1
          else:
              return mid
      return -1
  ```

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Methods for arranging the elements of a list in a specific order.
```

## Breaking Changes
- The structure of the example sections has changed to include more context and clarity.
- The format for documenting questions has been standardized to include descriptions and code snippets.
