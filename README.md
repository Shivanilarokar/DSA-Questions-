Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions
- Detailed solutions and explanations
- Updated example code for better accuracy and readability
- Community-driven contributions

## Summary of the Changes
In this latest update, the `README.md` file has been modified to enhance clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Addition of a new **Features** section for improved organization.
- Minor formatting improvements in code examples for better readability.

### Example Code
Here is an updated example of the Fibonacci sequence implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Feel free to contribute to this repository and help build a comprehensive resource for DSA learners!

We encourage you to explore, contribute, and enhance your skills in Data Structures and Algorithms! Happy coding! ðŸ˜ƒ
