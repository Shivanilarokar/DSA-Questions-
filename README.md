## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant improvements to the `README.md` file, enhancing the clarity and usability of the documentation for the DSA-Questions repository. The changes focus on providing a more structured overview, additional code examples, and explicit instructions on how to test the code. These modifications aim to facilitate a better understanding of the project for both new and experienced contributors.

In particular, we have consolidated the key highlights of the project, making it easier for users to identify the primary features and functionalities. The addition of small before-and-after code examples illustrates the impact of various algorithms and data structures, showcasing their usage in real-world scenarios.

## Highlights

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced structure and clarity to help users navigate the repository more effectively.
- **Code Examples**: Added clear, concise examples demonstrating the implementation of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: Detailed steps for testing the repository to ensure that users can easily verify functionality.

### Before/After Examples

#### Before

```python
# Insertion sort implementation
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
```

#### After

```python
# Insertion sort implementation with improved readability
def insertion_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm."""
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        # Move elements that are greater than key to one position ahead
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
    return arr
```

## Breaking Changes

- **Function Signatures**: Some function signatures have been updated to enhance clarity. Ensure that any scripts or modules relying on previous signatures are revised accordingly.
- **Removed Deprecated Functions**: Functions that were previously marked as deprecated have been removed. Please refer to the updated documentation to find alternatives.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Verify that all tests pass and inspect the output for any errors or failures.
