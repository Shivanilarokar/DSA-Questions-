   ```

2. **Updated Fibonacci Function Example**:
   ```python
   def fibonacci(n):
       if n <= 0:
           return []
       elif n == 1:
           return [0]
       elif n == 2:
           return [0, 1]
       else:
           fib_sequence = [0, 1]
           for i in range(2, n):
               fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
           return fib_sequence

   print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
   ```
