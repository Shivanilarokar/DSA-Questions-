# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README.md file to enhance clarity and provide a better user experience. The changes aim to make it easier for developers and contributors to understand the purpose of the repository, how to navigate through the data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions provided, and how to contribute effectively. With a more structured layout and additional examples, users can quickly grasp the content and utilize the repository to its full potential.

Additionally, we have incorporated a section that outlines the testing steps for contributors. This addition ensures that any changes made to the repository can be easily verified, fostering a collaborative environment that emphasizes quality and consistency in code contributions.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure:** The README now follows a more logical flow, with clear headings and subheadings that guide users through the content.
- **Code Examples:** We have added small code snippets to illustrate the implementation of key data structures and algorithms, making it easier for users to understand how to use the provided questions in practice.
- **Testing Instructions:** A dedicated section has been added to describe how to run tests, making it straightforward for contributors to validate their changes.

## Data Structures and Algorithms Questions

This repository contains a collection of questions designed to help you improve your understanding of data structures and algorithms.

### Example Question
```python
# Implement a binary search algorithm
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```
