## Features üîç
- Well-documented solutions with explanations.
- Coverage of a variety of data structures and algorithms.
- Contribution-friendly environment for sharing knowledge.
- Enhanced examples including edge case handling for key algorithms.

## Summary of the Changes üìù
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and engagement:

- **Introduction Update**: The introduction section has been rephrased for better readability.
- **Overview Section Added**: A new section has been added to provide a succinct overview of the repository's purpose.
- **Code Snippet Improvement**: Added an example of edge case handling in the Fibonacci function, demonstrating robustness in solutions.

### Code Snippet Example
Here‚Äôs an updated example of the Fibonacci function, now with improved edge case handling:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer"
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
print(fibonacci(0))  # Output: Input should be a positive integer
```

This function now includes handling for edge cases, ensuring robustness.
