# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes
In this update, we have enhanced the `README.md` file to provide clearer instructions and better organization for users navigating the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal of these changes is to improve accessibility to essential information about data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems, as well as to streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and users.

We introduced a structured format that highlights key sections such as project highlights, usage examples, and testing instructions. This restructuring aims to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of the repository's purpose and how to effectively utilize the resources available within.

## Highlights of the Update
- **Improved Organization**: Sections are now clearly delineated, making it easier to find specific information.
- **Clearer Examples**: Added code snippets that demonstrate how to implement various data structures and algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: Provided a straightforward guide for running tests, ensuring that users can easily verify their implementations.

### Code Examples
Here are a few concise examples demonstrating how to use some of the DSA functions:

#### Before
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

#### After
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two integers and returns the result."""
    return a + b
```

This change improves type hinting and documentation, making the function easier to understand and use.

## Breaking Changes
There are no breaking changes in this update; all existing functionalities remain intact. However, we encourage users to review the updated examples for best practices.

## How to Test
