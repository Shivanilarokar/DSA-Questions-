# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant improvements to the `README.md` file, enhancing its clarity and structure to better serve our contributors and users. The primary goal was to provide a more comprehensive overview of the project, including clearer instructions on how to contribute, run tests, and utilize the data structures and algorithms present in the repository. This change aims to streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and enhance the overall user experience.

Additionally, we have included a section highlighting the most important files within the repository, along with brief descriptions of their purposes. This will help users navigate the codebase more efficiently and understand the organization of the project. By improving the documentation, we hope to encourage more contributions and foster a collaborative environment.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The `README.md` file is now more informative, with a clearer structure and detailed descriptions.
- **Important Files Section**: A new section has been added to highlight key files and their functionalities.
- **Code Examples**: Added relevant code snippets to illustrate the usage of key data structures and algorithms.

### Example Code Snippet
```python
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README file has been significantly altered. Users should refer to the new documentation for updated instructions on contributing and using the project.
- Any references to outdated sections have been removed to maintain clarity.

## How to Test

To ensure that the changes are functioning as intended, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Review the updated `README.md` for clarity and completeness.

3. Run the test suite to verify that all algorithms and data structures are functioning correctly:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Check the code examples to confirm they are accurate and run without error.
