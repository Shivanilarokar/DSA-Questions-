# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the clarity and usability of the documentation, particularly the README file. The modifications aim to provide a better onboarding experience for new contributors and users by elaborating on the purpose and structure of the repository. Additionally, we have included more detailed instructions on how to navigate the data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions available in this repository.

The README now features improved formatting, making it easier to read and comprehend. We have added sections that outline the structure of the repository, examples of how to utilize the code, and a clearer description of the contribution process. This will help users quickly understand how to contribute their own questions or solutions and how to run tests effectively.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity in the purpose and usage of the repository.
- **Code Examples**: Added examples to illustrate how to implement certain algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions for contributing new questions or solutions.
- **Testing Instructions**: Step-by-step guide on how to run tests for the codebase.
