# DSA-Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces several enhancements and optimizations to the DSA-Questions repository, focusing on improving user experience and code maintainability. Key updates include refined examples, improved documentation clarity, and better organization of content to facilitate easier navigation through data structures and algorithms. The goal of these changes is to make the repository more accessible for both new learners and experienced developers looking to brush up on their DSA skills.

In addition to restructuring existing content, we've also added new examples that demonstrate the implementation of various algorithms and data structures in a more straightforward manner. This will help users quickly grasp the concepts and apply them in their own coding challenges. Overall, the updates aim to provide a clean and user-friendly interface while ensuring that the educational value remains high.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Refined Code Examples**: Improved clarity and consistency in the coding examples provided for each algorithm.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Sections are now better organized, making it easier to locate specific topics.
- **Updated Formatting**: Markdown formatting has been standardized for better readability and aesthetics.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1
```

**After:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```

## Breaking Changes

- The previous examples using iterative approaches have been standardized to use more efficient methods where applicable. Users should ensure they update their implementations accordingly.
