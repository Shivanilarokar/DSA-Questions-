git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage 📘
Here’s an example of how to approach a DSA question:

### Example Question: Two Sum
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

**Function Implementation:**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    # Implementation goes here...
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
