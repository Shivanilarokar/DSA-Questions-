Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to help you enhance your coding skills.

## Features
- A comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Solutions and explanations for each problem.
- Collaborative environment for contributors to improve and expand the repository. ðŸŽ‰

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide additional information:
- Improved wording for installation instructions.

cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, you can navigate to the desired problem folder and start coding! Here's a simple example of how to use one of the DSA functions:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Feel free to explore the repository, contribute, and enhance your understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms!
