# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces significant enhancements to the README.md file, aimed at improving clarity and navigation for users. The primary goal is to make it easier for developers and contributors to understand the structure of the repository, the types of data structures and algorithms covered, and how to effectively run tests. The revised README now includes a well-defined structure, making it more user-friendly.

The changes also include examples that illustrate how to use the various data structures and algorithms provided in the repository. By including concise code snippets, users can quickly grasp how to implement these concepts in their projects, thereby enhancing their learning experience.

## Highlights of the Update

1. **Improved Structure**: The README is now organized into distinct sections for better readability.
2. **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to demonstrate the usage of key data structures and algorithms.
3. **Testing Instructions**: Clearer steps have been provided for running tests, ensuring users can validate their implementations easily.

### Code Examples

Here are a couple of examples showcasing the use of a simple linked list and a binary search algorithm:

**Linked List Implementation:**

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node
```

**Binary Search Function:**

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has changed significantly, which may affect scripts or tools that rely on its previous format. Users should adapt their automation processes accordingly.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this repository, follow these steps:
