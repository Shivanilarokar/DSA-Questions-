# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant improvements to the README file, enhancing its clarity and usability for developers and contributors. The changes aim to provide a more structured overview of the project, making it easier for users to understand the purpose of the repository and how to get started. Additionally, we've incorporated examples that illustrate the implementation of various data structures and algorithms, which will help users grasp the concepts more effectively.

The updates include a more detailed description of the project, a comprehensive list of features, and before/after code snippets to demonstrate the improvements in the examples provided. This not only aids in understanding but also showcases the functionality of the algorithms implemented in the repository. 

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Project Description**: Added a clear introduction to the project and its objectives.
- **Structured Features Section**: Listed features in a bullet format for better readability.
- **Code Examples**: Provided before and after examples to illustrate the use of data structures and algorithms.

### Before/After Example

**Before:**
```python
def find_max(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val
```

**After:**
```python
def find_max(arr):
    """Returns the maximum value in a list."""
    return max(arr)
```
This example simplifies the function to leverage Python's built-in `max()` function, improving both readability and performance.

## Breaking Changes

- The `find_max` function has been refactored to use Python's built-in capabilities. Ensure that any existing implementations that rely on the previous logic are updated accordingly.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass and review the output for any discrepancies.
