## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions along with their solutions. It serves as a resource for both beginners and experienced developers looking to enhance their coding skills.

## Features

- A wide range of DSA questions.
- Well-documented solutions.
- Sample implementations in Python.
- Community contributions are encouraged!

## Summary of the Changes

In the latest commit, the `README.md` file has been updated to improve clarity and readability. Key changes include:

- Enhanced the overview for better understanding.
- Updated the visual theme from ðŸ“– to ðŸ“š.
- Enhanced the usage examples for better understanding.
- Provided a complete implementation for the `two_sum` function.

### Code Snippet Example

Hereâ€™s an updated example of how to use the `two_sum` function:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []

result = two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
```
