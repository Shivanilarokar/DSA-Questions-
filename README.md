Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- ü§ù **Open for contributions from the community**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md has been auto-updated to improve clarity and structure. Notable changes include:

- Addition of a new section header, "Features", to highlight key aspects of the repository.
- Minor adjustments to the Fibonacci function example for improved accuracy.

### Code Changes
Here is a brief overview of the code modifications made:

1. **Fibonacci Function Update:**
   - Changed the condition for the base case in the Fibonacci function from `if n == 1:` to `if n <= 1:` to handle both base cases in a single condition.

   ```python
   # Example of a Fibonacci function
   def fibonacci(n):
       if n <= 1:  # Updated condition
           return 1
       else:
           return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
   ```

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

Explore the repository to find a variety of DSA questions and solutions. Here's an example of the Fibonacci function:

```python
# Example of a Fibonacci function
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:  # Updated condition
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Feel free to dive into the questions and enhance your DSA skills!
