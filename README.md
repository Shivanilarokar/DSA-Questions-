```

## Usage ðŸ“–
You can explore various DSA questions and their solutions within this repository.

### Example of Fibonacci Function Implementation
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """This function calculates the Fibonacci number for a given `n`, demonstrating recursion."""
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```
This function calculates the Fibonacci number for a given `n`, demonstrating recursion and base case handling.
