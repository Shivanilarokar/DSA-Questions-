## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions with solutions aimed at helping you improve your coding skills.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions.
- Clear and structured solutions.
- Example usage for better understanding.

## Summary of the Changes ‚ú®
Recent updates have been made to enhance the clarity and structure of the README, along with code improvements. Notable changes include:
- Updated the title emoji from üåç to üöÄ.
- Improved the clarity of the overview section.
- Enhanced the Fibonacci function for better accuracy in handling edge cases.
- Added an example code section to demonstrate the Fibonacci function.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Here‚Äôs an example of the Fibonacci function implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Feel free to dive into the code, and we welcome contributions! Please open issues or submit pull requests to improve this repository.
