### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA-Questions
This repository contains various data structures and algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA-Questions

## Overview
DSA-Questions is a curated collection of data structures and algorithms designed to help developers master coding interviews and improve problem-solving skills.

## Features
- Implementations of common data structures (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees).
- Algorithms for sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.

## Example Usage
To use the binary search algorithm, import the function and call it as follows:
```python
from algorithms import binary_search

result = binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)
print(result)  # Output: 2 (index of the element)
```
```

## Breaking Changes
No breaking changes were introduced in this update. All existing functionalities remain intact, and the repository is backward compatible.
