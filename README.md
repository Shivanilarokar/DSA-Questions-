# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository improves the clarity and usability of the README file, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose of the project and how to contribute effectively. The changes focus on enhancing the documentation with structured content that guides users through the features, installation process, and testing methodologies.

Additionally, we have refined the code examples to illustrate common data structures and algorithms more effectively. This helps users visualize how to implement various solutions and provides a quick reference for best practices in coding styles.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes clear sections for installation, usage, and contribution guidelines, making it more user-friendly.
- **Improved Code Examples**: We added concise before-and-after code snippets that demonstrate the implementation of key data structures, such as linked lists and binary trees.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to run tests has been included to streamline the testing process for developers.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before: Basic Linked List Implementation**

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

**After: Enhanced Linked List with Methods**

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has been overhauled, so previous links to sections may not work as expected. Please refer to the new layout for updated navigation.
- Code examples have been refactored to include additional methods that enhance functionality. Existing implementations may need to be adjusted to accommodate these changes.

## How to Test

To ensure everything is functioning as expected after these changes, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Verify the output to ensure all tests pass without errors.
