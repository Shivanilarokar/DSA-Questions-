# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces significant enhancements to the documentation, specifically the README file. The primary goal of these changes is to improve clarity and usability for developers and contributors who are navigating the repository. By providing a more structured overview of the project and its purpose, we aim to foster a better understanding of the data structures and algorithms covered, as well as how to effectively contribute to the project.

In addition to improving the overall readability of the README, we have also incorporated small code examples to demonstrate key concepts and usage scenarios. This will help new users quickly grasp the practical applications of the algorithms and data structures included in the repository. Furthermore, the updated README outlines the steps required for testing, ensuring that contributors can validate their changes easily and efficiently.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now follows a more organized structure, making it easier for users to find relevant information.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets demonstrating the implementation of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clear and concise instructions on how to test changes have been included.

### Before and After

- Testing instructions provided.

## Examples
### Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The previous README structure has been completely revamped, which may result in broken links if they were referenced in external documentation or other repositories. Please ensure that any direct links to the README are updated accordingly.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the provided test cases to ensure that all algorithms function as expected:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

3. Review the README for clarity and completeness. Ensure that all code examples are accurate and executable.

4. If you have made changes, run the tests again to confirm that everything is still functioning correctly.
