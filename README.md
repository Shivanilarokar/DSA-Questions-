Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions.

## Overview
This repository includes various DSA problems categorized by type, with clear and concise implementations in Python. It serves as a learning resource for those looking to improve their coding skills and understanding of algorithms.

## Features
- A wide variety of DSA problems.
- Clear and concise code implementations.
- Detailed explanations and example usage for each algorithm.

## Summary of the Changes ðŸ”„
Recent updates to the README.md include enhancements to clarify the project purpose and improve the code examples. Key modifications are as follows:
- Added an **Overview** section to better describe the project.
- Consolidated badges for GitHub stars and forks.
- Improved formatting and clarity throughout the document.
- Updated the example usage section for better clarity and usability.

### Updated Binary Search Example
Hereâ€™s a quick look at the modified code snippet in the README:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Explore the various folders for different DSA problems and their respective solutions. Each problem includes sample inputs and outputs, along with the implementation details.

## Example
Here's a simple example of a binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
