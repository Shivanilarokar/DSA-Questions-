## Summary of Changes

In this update, we made significant enhancements to the README.md file to improve clarity and usability for developers and contributors. The primary objective was to provide a more structured overview of the repository, including clearer instructions on how to get started, contributing guidelines, and a more comprehensive explanation of the existing data structures and algorithms presented in the repository.

Additionally, we refined the formatting and organization of the document to ensure that it is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. This will help users quickly find the information they need and understand the overall purpose of the project.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Structure**: The README now features a clearer layout with distinct sections for getting started, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: We included small code snippets demonstrating how to implement various data structures and algorithms, making it easier for users to grasp the concepts.
- **Updated Contribution Guidelines**: A more detailed section on how to contribute, including coding standards and best practices.
- **Visual Improvements**: Improved formatting for better readability and navigation.
