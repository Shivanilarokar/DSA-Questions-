# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README.md file to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The primary aim of these changes is to provide a more structured and informative overview of the project, making it easier for new developers to understand the purpose and usage of the DSA Questions repository. The revisions include clearer headings, enhanced examples, and a more detailed explanation of how to contribute and test the project effectively.

Additionally, we have included sections that outline the highlights of the changes made, as well as breaking changes that users should be aware of. This will help maintain transparency and improve the user experience as the project evolves. The README now serves as a comprehensive guide that not only introduces the project but also facilitates smoother onboarding for new contributors.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now has a clearer hierarchy with distinct sections for installation, usage, contribution, and testing.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: We have added small before-and-after code examples to illustrate the changes and usage more effectively.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: A dedicated section has been created to inform users of any breaking changes that could affect their current implementations.

### Before and After Example

**Before:**

```python
def example_function(data):
    # do something
    return result
```

**After:**

```python
def example_function(data: list) -> list:
    """
    Processes the input data and returns the result.

    Args:
        data (list): A list of integers to process.

    Returns:
        list: A list containing processed results.
    """
    # Process data
    result = [x * 2 for x in data]
    return result
```

## Breaking Changes

- The `example_function` now requires a type hint for the input argument and return type. Ensure you update your calls to this function accordingly.

## How to Test

To test the changes in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite to verify that everything is functioning as expected:
   ```bash

   ```

4. Check for any issues or errors in the output. If all tests pass, your environment is set up correctly!
