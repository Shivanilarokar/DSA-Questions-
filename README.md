In this update, we have made significant enhancements to the `README.md` file to improve clarity and usability for contributors and users of the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal is to provide a more structured and informative guide that facilitates easier navigation and understanding of the project. This change is essential as it not only aids new contributors in getting started quickly but also helps seasoned developers to find relevant information with minimal effort.

We have included a brief overview of the project, highlighted key features, and provided examples that illustrate the functionality of the data structures and algorithms included in this repository. Additionally, we have ensured that the document is aesthetically pleasing and easy to read, making the onboarding experience smoother for everyone involved.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now follows a more logical flow, with clearly defined sections for project overview, features, examples, and testing instructions.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to demonstrate how to utilize the provided algorithms effectively.
- **Enhanced Clarity**: Reworded several sections to enhance readability and understanding of the concepts presented.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can implement a simple binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```
