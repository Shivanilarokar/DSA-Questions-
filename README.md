# DSA Questions

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the clarity and structure of the README file. The adjustments aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the project and its purpose, ensuring that users can quickly grasp the key functionalities and how to get started. By refining the documentation, we hope to improve user experience and engagement with the repository.

In addition to formatting improvements, the README now includes clear sections for highlights, code examples, and testing instructions. These changes are designed to facilitate easier navigation and provide essential information at a glance, which is particularly beneficial for new contributors and users exploring the data structures and algorithms included in this repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README has been reorganized for better readability, with distinct sections for project summary, highlights, examples, breaking changes, and testing steps.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise before/after examples to illustrate the application of data structures and algorithms in practical scenarios.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clear steps have been provided for testing the implemented algorithms, helping contributors verify their changes effectively.

### Before/After Example

**Before:**
```python
# Function to find the maximum element in a list
def find_max(lst):
    return max(lst)
```

**After:**
```python
# Enhanced function to find the maximum element in a list
def find_max(lst):
    """Return the maximum element in the given list."""
    if not lst:
        raise ValueError("List must not be empty.")
    return max(lst)
```

### Breaking Changes

- The `find_max` function now raises a `ValueError` if called with an empty list. This change enforces better error handling and prevents unexpected behavior.

## How to Test

To ensure that the changes work as intended, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

3. Verify that all tests pass, and review any changes in functionality.
