## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of data structure and algorithm questions designed to help you improve your coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Features
- Comprehensive set of DSA questions.
- Solutions provided in Python.
- Easy to navigate and clone for local use.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the following changes were made:
- Updated the title emoji to a robot emoji ðŸ¤–.
- Added instructions for navigating into the cloned repository directory.
- Improved variable naming for clarity in the Fibonacci function.

## Installation ðŸš€
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the updated Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
