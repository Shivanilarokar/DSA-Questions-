## Overview
The DSA Questions repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms problems designed to enhance your coding skills and prepare you for technical interviews.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Code examples in Python üêç
- Clear explanations for each problem
- Community-driven contributions ü§ù

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Simplified language for better understanding
- Updated features list to reflect current offerings
- Improved example usage section

### Example Usage
Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to use the `two_sum` function:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    result = two_sum(nums, target)
    print(result)  # Output: [0, 1] since nums[0] + nums[1] equals target
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Navigate to the specific problem folder and run the corresponding Python files to see the solutions.
