# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary

This update to the README.md file enhances the documentation of the DSA Questions repository, providing clearer guidance to users and contributors. The changes aim to improve the overall user experience by clearly outlining the purpose of the repository, the structure of the code, and how to effectively engage with the project. Additionally, it includes small before/after code examples to illustrate the functionality of the algorithms implemented.

The DSA Questions repository serves as a collection of data structures and algorithms problems, accompanied by solutions in various programming languages. This update not only refines the existing content but also introduces new sections to help users navigate through the repository with ease, ensuring that both beginners and experienced developers can find valuable resources.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Clarity**: Enhanced explanations of the repository's purpose and structure.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise before/after code snippets to demonstrate algorithm implementations.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Introduced a section outlining how contributors can add their own solutions or improve existing ones.

### Before/After Examples

#### Before:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

#### After:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

## Breaking Changes

No breaking changes have been introduced in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, ensuring backward compatibility for users relying on the previous versions of the repository.

## How to Test

To verify the changes made in this update, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Review the updated README.md file for clarity and structure.

3. Run the provided code examples in your local environment to ensure they function as expected.

4. If you are a contributor, try adding a new algorithm or enhancing an existing one based on the updated contribution guidelines.
