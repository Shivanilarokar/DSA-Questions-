# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant enhancements to the README file of the DSA Questions repository. The primary focus of these changes is to improve clarity and usability for developers and contributors. We've added detailed sections that outline how to contribute effectively, provided clearer installation instructions, and included examples to illustrate the usage of key features. 

Additionally, we've refined the overall structure of the README to ensure that essential information is easily accessible. This update aims to foster a better understanding of the repository's purpose and to streamline the onboarding process for new contributors. 

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Clarity**: Improved explanations of data structures and algorithms covered in the repository.
- **Installation Instructions**: Added step-by-step guidance for setting up the project locally.
- **Usage Examples**: Included small code snippets demonstrating how to utilize various algorithms effectively.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clearly defined steps for contributing to the project, including coding standards and pull request procedures.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  
  ```python
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
      return arr
  ```

### Searching Algorithms
- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
  
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while left <= right:
          mid = left + (right - left) // 2
          if arr[mid] == target:
              return mid
          elif arr[mid] < target:
              left = mid + 1
          else:
              right = mid - 1
      return -1
  ```
```
