## Summary of Changes
This update to the DSA Questions repository focuses on enhancing the clarity and usability of the README.md file. The changes introduce a more structured format, better navigation, and additional context for contributors and users. By improving the documentation, we aim to facilitate easier onboarding for new users and provide a clearer understanding of the projectâ€™s purpose and usage.

In addition to structural improvements, we have included examples that illustrate common data structures and algorithms, making it easier for users to grasp the concepts quickly. The README now serves as a comprehensive guide that not only explains the repository's contents but also provides actionable insights for practical implementation.

## Highlights of the Changes
- Enhanced structure for better readability and navigation.
- Added code examples for common data structures and algorithms.
- Updated contribution guidelines for clarity.
- Improved installation instructions and usage examples.

## Overview
This repository provides a collection of data structure and algorithm questions to help enhance your coding skills.

## Code Examples
### Example: Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes
- The structure of the README file has been fundamentally changed to improve clarity, which may affect any existing links or references to specific sections. Users are encouraged to review the updated content thoroughly.
