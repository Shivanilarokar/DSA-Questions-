Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a learning platform for individuals interested in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It features a variety of questions and solutions, making it an excellent resource for both beginners and seasoned programmers.

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms questions along with their solutions implemented in Python. It's an ideal resource for interview preparation and skill enhancement.

## Features âœ¨

- Comprehensive questions covering a wide range of DSA topics.
- Solutions implemented in Python for easy understanding.
- Ideal for interview preparation and skill enhancement.

## Summary of Changes

In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to provide a more structured overview of the repository. Key changes include:

- Added badges for last commit, issues, and pull requests for better visibility.
- Introduced an "Overview" section to give a clearer picture of the repository's purpose.
- Updated example usage of the Fibonacci function in the code snippet for clarity.

### Code Changes

Here are some snippets from the updated README.md:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

## Installation

To get started with this repository, clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory:
