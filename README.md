Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository is dedicated to providing solutions and resources for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems for practice and learning. Whether you are preparing for interviews or enhancing your coding skills, this repository is a great resource.

## Overview

The DSA Questions repository is designed to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms problems for practice and learning.

## Features

- 📚 **Comprehensive Collection**: Access a wide array of DSA questions.
- 📝 **Detailed Explanations**: Each question comes with explanations and sample solutions.
- 🤝 **User Contributions**: Easily contribute your own solutions and improvements.

## Summary of the Changes

In this update, the README.md file has been refined to improve clarity and presentation. Key changes include:

- Enhanced the **Features** list for clarity with emojis for better readability.
- Added a placeholder comment in the sample Python code to indicate where users should place their solutions.
- Updated the example usage section to provide a clearer context for users.
- Minor adjustments in wording for consistency and professionalism.

## Installation

To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage

Navigate to the directory and explore the various DSA problems available. You can also contribute by adding your own solutions.

```python
# Example of a sample solution
def example_solution():
    # Place your solution here
    pass
```

## Example

Here's how you might use one of the algorithms provided in this repository:

```python
# Example usage of a sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Sample array
sample_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(sample_array)
print("Sorted array is:", sample_array)
```

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute your solutions or improvements!
