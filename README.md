# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
In this update, we have made significant enhancements to the `README.md` file to improve clarity and usability for users and contributors. The modifications include a more structured overview of the project, an updated table of contents, and the addition of example code snippets that demonstrate how to effectively use the data structures and algorithms included in the repository. This aims to provide a better onboarding experience for new developers and users who want to leverage the content of this repository.

Additionally, we have refined the formatting of sections for improved readability and accessibility. These changes are intended to ensure that users can quickly find the information they need and understand how to implement the various algorithms and data structures provided in the repository.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Enhanced Project Overview**: A clearer description of the projectâ€™s purpose and objectives.
- **Structured Table of Contents**: Easy navigation to different sections of the README.
- **Example Code Snippets**: Practical examples showcasing the usage of key algorithms and data structures.
- **Improved Formatting**: Better visual hierarchy and readability.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before: Basic Sorting Example**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

**After: Enhanced Sorting Example with Comments**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

## Breaking Changes
- No breaking changes have been introduced in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, and the enhancements are additive.

## How to Test
To verify the updates and ensure that the examples work as intended, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Navigate to the algorithms directory and run the provided example scripts:
   ```bash
   cd algorithms/sorting
   python bubble_sort_example.py
   ```

3. Check the output to ensure that the sorting algorithm functions correctly.

4. Review the `README.md` for any changes and confirm that the formatting and examples appear correctly.
