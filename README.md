# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

In this update, the README file has been enhanced to provide clearer guidance and improved structure for users of the DSA Questions repository. The objective is to ensure that both newcomers and experienced developers can quickly grasp the purpose of the repository and effectively utilize its resources. The enhancements include a more detailed summary of the project, organized sections for highlights, and a streamlined format for code examples.

Additionally, we have improved the documentation surrounding installation and testing instructions to facilitate a smoother onboarding experience. This will help users to set up the environment quickly and understand how to contribute to the project efficiently.

## Highlights

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity and structure in the README for better user experience.
- **Code Examples**: Added before and after code snippets to illustrate key changes and usage.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clearer steps on how to test the code and verify functionality.

## Code Examples

### Before

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### After

```python
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Adds two integers and returns the result.
    
    Parameters:
    a (int): First number
    b (int): Second number
    
    Returns:
    int: Sum of a and b
    """
    return a + b
```

The above example demonstrates the transition from a basic function to a more descriptive one with type annotations and a docstring, enhancing readability and usability.
