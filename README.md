# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces enhancements to the README file, providing clearer instructions and a more structured approach to navigating the DSA Questions repository. The primary focus of these changes is to improve the onboarding experience for new contributors and users, ensuring that they can quickly understand the purpose of the repository, the types of data structures and algorithms covered, and how to effectively contribute.

In addition to improving the documentation, we've included more detailed explanations of the testing process, allowing users to validate their implementations more effectively. The README now features a section that outlines how to run tests, providing clear command-line instructions to ensure smooth execution.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Added detailed sections on repository structure and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Included small before-and-after code snippets to illustrate changes made.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clarified the steps needed to run tests locally.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
## Running Tests
Run the tests to validate your code.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Running Tests

To run the tests locally, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm test
```
This command will execute all the test cases defined in the `tests` directory.
```

## Breaking Changes

- **Testing Framework Update**: The repository has been updated to use Jest for testing instead of Mocha. Users will need to install Jest as a dependency if they haven't already.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
