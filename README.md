### Example: Binary Search Implementation
Here is a simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in Python:

```python
# Example of a simple DSA implementation
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

We encourage you to explore the repository and contribute to the growing collection of DSA questions and solutions!
