# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have enhanced the clarity and usability of the `README.md` file for the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal was to improve the documentation by providing clearer instructions and more detailed examples for users looking to understand and utilize the data structures and algorithms (DSA) solutions available in this repository. This update aims to foster better engagement from developers and learners alike, ensuring they can easily navigate and contribute to the project.

We have also added sections that outline how to contribute to the repository, along with a clear guide on how to test the provided solutions. This will help new contributors understand the contribution process and enable them to run tests effectively, ensuring the integrity of the codebase.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved explanations for various algorithms and data structures.
- **Code Examples**: Added small before/after code snippets for better clarity.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Introduced a section dedicated to guiding potential contributors.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clearly outlined steps for running tests and verifying solutions.

### Before/After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```
*In the updated example, we added type hints and a docstring to improve code readability and usability.*

## Breaking Changes

- None in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, ensuring backward compatibility.
