## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the documentation within the `README.md` file, providing clearer guidance on the usage and structure of the DSA Questions repository. The goal is to improve user onboarding and make it easier for contributors to understand the project's purpose and contribution guidelines. This version highlights the importance of data structures and algorithms (DSA) in programming interviews and competitive coding, making the repository more accessible to newcomers.

Additionally, we have included more detailed examples of how to utilize the provided solutions, ensuring that users can quickly grasp the implementations and adapt them for their own use cases. This will not only facilitate learning but also encourage more contributions from the community.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation:** Enhanced explanations of the repository's purpose and structure.
- **Code Examples:** Added clear, concise code snippets to demonstrate the usage of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines:** Explicit instructions on how to contribute effectively to the project.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before

```markdown
# DSA Questions
This repository contains various DSA questions.
```

#### After

```markdown
# DSA Questions

This repository contains a curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions commonly asked in technical interviews and competitive programming. Each question includes a detailed solution, explanation, and sample code. 

## Code Example

Here's a quick example of a binary search implementation:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```
