## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant enhancements to the README.md file to improve clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The changes focus on providing a more structured overview of the project, including a clearer summary, detailed sections for features, and enhanced instructions on how to test the code. These improvements aim to foster better understanding and engagement within the community, making it easier for developers to contribute effectively.

Additionally, we've streamlined the code examples and added more context to the usage sections. This ensures that both new and experienced users can quickly grasp how to implement the data structures and algorithms provided in this repository. The updated documentation reflects our commitment to maintaining high-quality, accessible resources for learning and collaboration in the field of data structures and algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README is now organized into clear sections for easier navigation.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Code snippets have been refined to better illustrate usage and functionality.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to test the code has been added to facilitate contributions.

### Before and After Code Example

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```

This change introduces type hints to enhance code readability and maintainability, providing clarity on the expected input and output types.

## Breaking Changes

- **Function Signatures**: Some function signatures have been updated to include type hints. Ensure that your calls to these functions reflect the new signatures to avoid type errors.
