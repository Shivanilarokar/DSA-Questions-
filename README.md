# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
In this update, we have enhanced the README file to improve clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The primary focus was to include detailed explanations of the data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions present in this repository, ensuring that both novice and experienced developers can find the information they need quickly. We also standardized the format of the examples and provided additional context for each section to facilitate better understanding.

Furthermore, we added a "How to Test" section to guide users through the process of running and verifying the correctness of the code. This change aims to foster a collaborative environment where contributors can efficiently engage with the project and ensure code quality through comprehensive testing.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated the README with clear descriptions of the repository's purpose and structure.
- **Standardized Examples**: Improved code examples to follow a consistent format for better readability.
- **Testing Instructions**: Added a dedicated section on how to test the code, making it easier for contributors to validate their changes.

### Before and After Examples
**Before**:
```markdown
## Example
Here is an example of a question.
```

**After**:
```markdown
## Example: Merge Two Sorted Lists
Given two sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted list.

### Code Example
```python
def merge_two_lists(l1, l2):
    # Create a dummy node to help with merging
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    tail = dummy
    while l1 and l2:
        if l1.val < l2.val:
            tail.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            tail.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        tail = tail.next
    tail.next = l1 or l2
    return dummy.next
```
```
