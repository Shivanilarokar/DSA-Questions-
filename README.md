## Features
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ✍️ **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- 🔍 **Structured example format for better understanding**
- ⚙️ **Installation instructions for easy setup**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Added a dedicated **Features** section for better visibility.
- Added a dedicated **Installation** section to facilitate easier setup.
- Updated the code snippet for a simple DSA question solution using the Fibonacci sequence for better clarity and performance.

### Example Code Snippet
Here’s an updated example of a simple DSA question solution using the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
