## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant improvements to the README documentation of the DSA Questions repository. The objective is to provide clearer guidance on how to navigate the codebase, understand the structure of data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions, and enhance the overall usability for contributors and users alike. By refining the existing content and adding essential sections, we aim to empower developers with the necessary information to effectively engage with the project.

In addition to the documentation enhancements, we've included a structured example highlighting the usage of common data structures, making it easier for users to grasp the implementation and application of these algorithms. This change not only facilitates a better understanding of the code but also encourages best practices among contributors.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Expanded Documentation**: The README now includes detailed sections on how to contribute, code structure, and usage examples.
- **Code Examples**: Added relevant code snippets to demonstrate the implementation of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions on how to contribute to the repository, including coding standards and testing procedures.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions

This repo contains questions and solutions for data structures and algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions Repository

Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! Here, you will find a collection of questions and solutions for various data structures and algorithms.

## Contribution Guidelines

To contribute, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Submit a pull request.

## Code Example

Hereâ€™s an implementation of a simple linked list:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. However, users are encouraged to review the new guidelines and examples to fully leverage the enhancements made to the documentation.

## How to Test

To ensure the integrity of the changes made, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
    cd DSA-Questions
    ```

2. Review the updated README by opening it in your preferred text editor or Markdown viewer.

3. Run any existing tests to confirm that the codebase remains functional:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover
    ```

4. Optionally, create a new branch and add your own examples or contributions to see how the documentation improves the overall understanding of the project.
