## Overview
The DSA Questions repository aims to provide a variety of coding challenges that cover fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms. Each question is accompanied by clear solutions and coding examples in multiple programming languages.

## Features
- **Diverse Questions**: Explore a wide range of DSA problems.
- **Multiple Languages**: Solutions provided in various programming languages.
- **Clear Explanations**: Each solution includes detailed explanations for better understanding.

## Summary of Changes
In the latest commit, the README.md file has been updated to improve clarity and conciseness. The following changes were made:
- Removed redundant wording for a more streamlined overview.
- Added a comment in the example algorithm to enhance code readability.

### Code Changes
Hereâ€™s a snippet of the modified code in the README.md:

```python
def example_algorithm(data):
    # Example implementation
    return sorted(data)

print(example_algorithm([5, 2, 9, 1]))
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:
