Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions
- Detailed solutions and explanations
- Community-driven contributions

## Summary of the Changes
In this latest update, the `README.md` file has been modified to enhance clarity and provide a better user experience. Key changes include:
- Added a new **Features** section to highlight the repository's offerings.
- Revised the **Installation** and **Usage** sections for improved clarity.
- Updated the **Example** section with a more relevant DSA question.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and explore the DSA questions and their solutions.

## Example
Here is a simple example of a Fibonacci function implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Feel free to contribute by submitting your own questions and solutions to help grow this repository!

We encourage you to explore, contribute, and enhance your skills in Data Structures and Algorithms! Happy coding! ðŸ˜ƒ
