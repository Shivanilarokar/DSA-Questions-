This update introduces significant enhancements to the README documentation for the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal of these changes is to improve clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. We have restructured the content to provide a more intuitive navigation experience, ensuring that important information is easily accessible.

Additionally, we have added detailed sections explaining the purpose of the repository, which focuses on various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions. This includes a clearer breakdown of the different types of questions available and their corresponding difficulty levels. By providing examples and a more organized layout, we aim to foster a better understanding of the repository's offerings.
