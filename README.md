# DSA-Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant enhancements to the `README.md` file, aimed at improving clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The changes focus on providing a more structured overview of the project, including detailed sections that explain the purpose, features, and how to contribute effectively. By enhancing the documentation, we aim to foster a better understanding of the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions repository, making it easier for developers and learners to navigate the content.

Additionally, we've included small code examples to illustrate the usage of various algorithms and data structures included in the repository. This will help users grasp the concepts more quickly and apply them in their coding challenges. The revised README also emphasizes the importance of testing and provides clear instructions on how to run tests for the project.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now follows a more logical structure, with clear section headings for easy navigation.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise code snippets to demonstrate the implementation of key algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: Included a dedicated section for how to run tests, ensuring contributors can validate their changes effectively.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions
Some description about the repository.

**Code Example:**

**Before:**
```python
# Example function
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
# Example function to add two numbers
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Adds two integers and returns the result.
    """
    return a + b

# Example usage:
result = add(5, 7)
print(result)  # Output: 12
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has been significantly altered. Users should refer to the new sections for updated information and guidelines.
- Any previously existing examples that were not aligned with the new format have been removed or replaced.

## How to Test

To ensure that everything is functioning as expected, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

3. Verify that all tests pass successfully. If any tests fail, review the output for details.
