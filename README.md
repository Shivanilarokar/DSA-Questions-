# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository primarily enhances the README.md file to better inform users about the project's purpose, structure, and usage. Clearer documentation not only aids new contributors but also enhances the overall user experience for those seeking to improve their data structures and algorithms skills through practical examples. The new README provides a more comprehensive overview of the repository, making it easier to navigate and understand.

Additionally, we have included detailed sections on the features of the repository, small before-and-after code examples for clarity, and information on breaking changes that could affect current users. These improvements are aimed at streamlining the onboarding process for new contributors and providing existing users with the necessary context for utilizing the repository effectively.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now offers a structured overview of the project, including sections on features, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Before-and-after examples have been added to illustrate key concepts and changes effectively.
- **Breaking Changes**: Notable breaking changes have been documented to inform users of any adjustments they may need to make.

### Before/After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def example_function(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```

**After:**
```python
def example_function(arr):
    """Sorts the input array in ascending order."""
    return sorted(arr)

# Usage
print(example_function([3, 1, 2]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

## Breaking Changes

1. **Function Signature Update**: The `example_function` now includes a docstring for better clarity on its functionality.
2. **Behavioral Changes**: Any functions that previously returned unsorted arrays have been updated to ensure consistent behavior throughout the repository.
