## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have significantly improved the README file to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The changes include a more structured format, additional examples, and clearer instructions on how to contribute and test the project. This is part of our ongoing effort to maintain high-quality documentation that reflects the current state of the repository and its features.

The README now includes a dedicated section for highlights, making it easier for users to quickly grasp the core functionalities and benefits of the project. Additionally, we have added small before-and-after code examples to illustrate the impact of recent changes, thereby providing practical insights into the functionality and usage of the data structures and algorithms covered in this repository.

## Highlights

- Added structured sections for easier navigation.
- Included small code examples to demonstrate usage.
- Clarified contribution guidelines and testing instructions.

## Code Example

### Before

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### After

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```

This example showcases the transition to type hints, which improves code readability and helps developers understand the expected input and output types.

## Breaking Changes

- The function signatures have been updated to include type hints for better clarity. Ensure that any existing code using these functions is updated accordingly.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
