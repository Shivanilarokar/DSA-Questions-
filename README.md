# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the existing documentation in the README file to provide clearer guidance for users and contributors. By expanding the sections on usage, installation, and contribution guidelines, we aim to make the project more accessible to newcomers while ensuring that experienced developers have the information they need to contribute effectively.

Additionally, we have included examples of common data structures and algorithms that are implemented in this repository. These examples serve as quick references for users looking to understand how to utilize the code effectively. Overall, this update is part of our ongoing effort to improve the usability and maintainability of the project.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Expanded Documentation**: Added detailed instructions on how to install and run the project.
- **Examples Section**: Included code snippets illustrating the usage of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clarified how contributors can submit their own questions and solutions.

### Code Examples

#### Before

```python
# Function to perform a binary search
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Implementation here
```

#### After

```python
# Function to perform a binary search
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Perform binary search on a sorted array.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): A list of sorted elements.
    target (any): The element to search for.

    Returns:
    int: The index of the target element in the array, or -1 if not found.
    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
