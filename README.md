# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository focuses on enhancing the documentation within the `README.md` file to provide clearer guidance for users and contributors. With the growing complexity of data structures and algorithms (DSA) challenges, having a well-structured README is crucial for effective navigation and understanding of the repository's contents. This update includes a more detailed overview of the repository, outlines the purpose of each section, and provides clearer usage instructions for contributors.

Additionally, we have refined the examples provided to illustrate common use cases more effectively. This not only aids in comprehension for beginners but also improves the overall quality of the documentation, making it easier for developers to engage with the project.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Expanded Overview**: The introduction now provides a clearer explanation of the repository's purpose, structure, and how to contribute.
- **Improved Code Examples**: Updated examples to better demonstrate key algorithms and data structures, including input and output formats.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Added a section detailing how to contribute, including coding standards and submission processes.

### Before and After Examples

**Before** (Old example):

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Search logic here
    return index
```

**After** (Updated example):

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Perform binary search on a sorted array.
    
    Parameters:
    arr (List[int]): A sorted list of integers.
    target (int): The integer to search for.

    Returns:
    int: The index of the target if found, else -1.
    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function signatures have been updated to include detailed docstrings, which may affect the way existing code interacts with these functions. Ensure to adapt your calls to these functions accordingly.

## How to Test

To verify that the changes are functioning as intended and that the documentation is clear and helpful, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Check out the latest commit:
   ```bash
   git checkout efeb45811788c5503e6e963d442f32f798ee93a4
   ```

3. Run the provided test cases to ensure the functionality remains intact:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

4. Review the updated `README.md` for clarity and completeness. If you find areas for improvement, consider submitting a pull request with your suggestions.
