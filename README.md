```

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and start exploring the various DSA questions.

## Usage
To calculate Fibonacci numbers, you can use the `fibonacci` function as shown in the code snippet below:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```
