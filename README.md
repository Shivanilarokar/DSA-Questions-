## Overview
This repository serves as a collaborative platform for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) enthusiasts. It aims to provide a collection of DSA questions along with their solutions to help learners and developers enhance their coding skills.

## Features âœ¨
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions.
- Detailed solutions to enhance understanding.
- Community-driven contributions.

## Summary of the Changes ðŸ“±
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced for better readability and clarity. Additionally, the Fibonacci function has been improved to handle edge cases more effectively.

### Key Changes:
- Improved formatting and clarity in the README.
- Updated example for using the Fibonacci function.

### Updated Fibonacci Function Example:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to n"""
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```
