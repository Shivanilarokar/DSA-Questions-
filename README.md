## ✨ Features

| Feature                           | Description                                                       |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitHub Client**                 | Interact with GitHub's API to fetch file contents and manage repositories. |
| **Data Structures and Algorithms**| A curated list of DSA questions for practice.                     |
| **Environment Variable Support**   | Uses a GitHub token stored in environment variables for secure API access. |

## ⬇️ Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
   cd DSA-Questions-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed and then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your GitHub token**:
   You need to set your GitHub token as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

To use the `GitHubClient` class to fetch file contents from a repository, follow this example:

```python
from sweety import GitHubClient

# Initialize the GitHub client
client = GitHubClient()

# Fetch file content from a specific repository
file_content, file_sha = client.get_file('Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-', 'README.md')

print("File Content:", file_content)
print("File SHA:", file_sha)
```

## 📖 Examples

### GitHub Client Implementation

Here's a snippet of the newly added `GitHubClient` class in `sweety.py`:

```python
class GitHubClient:
    def __init__(self, token: Optional[str] = None):
        self.token = token or os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
        if not self.token:
            raise ValueError("❌ GitHub token not provided. Set GITHUB_TOKEN env variable.")
        self.api_base = "https://api.github.com"

    def _headers(self):
        return {
            "Authorization": f"token {self.token}",
            "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
        }

    def get_file(self, repo: str, path: str, branch: str = "master") -> Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str]]:
        """Fetch file content + sha from GitHub repo."""
```

### File Removal

The previous `newcode.py` file contained logging setup code which has now been removed to streamline the functionality.
