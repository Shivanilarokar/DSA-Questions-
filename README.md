## Features
- ðŸš€ **Categorized DSA problems** for easy navigation
- ðŸ“š **Clear explanations and solutions** for each problem
- ðŸŽ¯ **Example problems** to illustrate usage

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest commit, the README.md file has been updated to:
- Add a dedicated **Features** section to highlight key aspects of the repository.
- Improve the installation instructions for clarity.
- Refine the usage section to provide better guidance for users.

git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
You can run the example problems included in the repository. Below is a sample code snippet:

```python
def example_problem(input_data):
    # Sample logic for demonstration
    return input_data * 2

input_data = 5
output = example_problem(input_data)
print(f"The output is: {output}")
```

## Example
To see how the problems work, you can modify the `input_data` in the example above and run the code to see different outputs.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
