Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through a comprehensive collection of questions and solutions.

## Features 🌟
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ⚙️ **Well-documented solutions** to enhance understanding
- 🔄 **Regular updates** and improvements based on community feedback
- 🚀 **Efficient algorithm implementations**

## Summary of the Changes 📝
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Addition of a new **Features** section for improved organization.
- Updated the code snippet for a simple DSA question solution using the Fibonacci sequence for better clarity and performance.
- Updated the **Installation** section to facilitate easier setup.

### Example Code Snippet
Here's an improved example of a Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
