# DSA-Questions

## Summary

This update enhances the DSA-Questions repository by improving the structure and clarity of the README file. The primary goal is to provide a more informative and user-friendly introduction to the project, making it easier for new contributors and users to understand the purpose and functionality of the repository. Key sections have been added to highlight features, usage, and contribution guidelines.

In addition to structural improvements, the README now includes examples demonstrating how to utilize various data structures and algorithms included in the repository. By providing clear before-and-after examples, users can quickly grasp how to implement the algorithms effectively in their own projects.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The README has been reorganized for better readability, with distinct sections for features, examples, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise code snippets that illustrate the implementation of key algorithms, making it easier for users to get started.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions for how to contribute to the project, including coding standards and testing protocols.

### Before/After Code Examples

**Before**: 
```python
# Example of a simple bubble sort implementation
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**After**: 
```python
# Bubble Sort Implementation
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
    :param arr: List of elements to be sorted
    :return: Sorted list
    """
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update; however, the organization of the documentation may require users to adapt how they navigate the README. Users should find the new structure more intuitive.
