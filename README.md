## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity and structure of the README.
- **Added Code Examples**: Included succinct examples for key data structures and algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Updated instructions on how to contribute to the project.

### Before and After Example

**Before:**
```markdown
## Algorithms
This repo contains various algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms, including:

- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort

### Example: Quick Sort
```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
```
```
