This repository is dedicated to helping developers and students improve their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through a collection of curated questions and solutions.

## Features âœ¨
- A collection of DSA questions to practice and enhance your skills.
- Solutions provided in Python for easy understanding.
- Detailed explanations and examples for better learning.
- Well-structured content for improved readability.
- Clear instructions for installation and usage.
- Community-driven: contributions are welcome!

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the `README.md` file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide better guidance for users. The following changes were made:
- Added a dedicated **Features** section to highlight the main offerings.
- Improved clarity in the **Usage** section to encourage exploration of DSA problems.
- Updated the **Example** section with a more illustrative Python function.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

You can start practicing with the DSA questions by navigating to the respective directories.

## Usage
Explore the various DSA questions and their solutions. Each question is designed to help you grasp important concepts in data structures and algorithms.

## Example
Hereâ€™s an example of a simple Python function demonstrating a common algorithm:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence
```
This function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number, showcasing how to implement algorithms in Python effectively.
