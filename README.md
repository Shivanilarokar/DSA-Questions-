# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant improvements to the README documentation for the DSA Questions repository. The aim is to enhance clarity and provide a more structured overview of the project, making it easier for developers and contributors to understand the purpose and usage of the repository. Key sections have been added to highlight the features, usage examples, and testing instructions, ensuring that users can quickly get up to speed with the project.

Additionally, we have made minor formatting adjustments and corrections to ensure consistency and readability across the document. This update reflects our commitment to maintaining high-quality documentation that evolves alongside the codebase.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved the overall structure of the README to include clearer sections and headings.
- **Code Examples**: Added before and after code examples to illustrate changes made to specific algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: Included a detailed "How to Test" section to guide users in running tests effectively.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**

```python
def find_max(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val
```

**After:**

```python
def find_max(arr):
    """Returns the maximum value in the array."""
    return max(arr)  # Simplified using built-in max function
```

## Breaking Changes

- The `find_max` function has been refactored to utilize Python's built-in `max()` function, improving both performance and readability. Ensure that any custom implementations relying on the previous version are updated accordingly.
