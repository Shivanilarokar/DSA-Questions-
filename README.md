# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes
This update to the DSA Questions repository primarily focuses on enhancing the documentation within the `README.md` file. The changes aim to provide clearer instructions and examples for users navigating through the data structures and algorithms questions. By improving the readability and organization of the content, we hope to foster a more engaging learning experience for both beginners and advanced developers.

In addition to the structural changes, we have also included updated examples that illustrate how to use various algorithms and data structures effectively. This will help users to better understand the implementation of the DSA concepts and apply them in practice. The overall goal of this update is to streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and users alike.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced explanations and organized sections for better navigation.
- **New Examples**: Added code snippets that demonstrate the usage of key algorithms and data structures.
- **Clarity in Instructions**: Simplified language and improved formatting for easier comprehension.

### Before / After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a simple bubble sort function
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved bubble sort implementation with comments
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm.
    
    Parameters:
        arr (list): The list of elements to be sorted.
        
    Returns:
        list: Sorted list.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

## Breaking Changes
- No breaking changes were introduced in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, ensuring backward compatibility for users relying on previous implementations.
