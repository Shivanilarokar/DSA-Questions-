## Overview
This repository is dedicated to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, providing a platform for users to practice and improve their coding skills. It aims to help developers understand various algorithms and data structures through practical examples.

## Features
- A collection of DSA problems and their solutions.
- Examples of common algorithms with clear code implementations.
- Contribution guidelines to help users add their own solutions.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been refined to enhance clarity and presentation. Key changes include:
- Updated title emoji from ðŸ“š to ðŸ“– for better representation.
- Improved installation instructions for clarity.
- Added a more detailed usage section with a clear example of a sorting algorithm.
- Enhanced the example section with a concrete implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

Navigate to the directory and explore the various DSA problems available. You can also contribute by adding your own solutions.

## Usage
Here's an example of how to structure your solution:

```python
# Example of a sample solution
def example_solution():
    # Place your solution here
    pass
```

## Example
Here's how you might use one of the algorithms provided in this repository:

```python
# Example usage of a sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Sample array
sample_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(sample_array)
print("Sorted array is:", sample_array)
```

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute your solutions or improvements!
