- Easy navigation and usage for better practice.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been refined for clarity and consistency. The following changes were made:

- Enhanced the language for better readability.
- Improved the example section with a more relevant code snippet demonstrating a DSA problem.

### Code Changes:
```python
# Example of a DSA problem
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

## Installation
