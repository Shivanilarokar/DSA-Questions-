# DSA-Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces several enhancements and optimizations to the existing algorithms and data structures in the DSA-Questions repository. Our goal is to improve both the performance and readability of the code, making it easier for developers and learners to understand and implement these solutions. Additionally, we have reorganized some sections in the README to provide better clarity on how to use the repository and its contents.

Key improvements include the addition of new algorithm implementations, refined documentation, and minor bug fixes. These changes aim to provide users with a more robust experience when navigating through the various data structures and algorithms available in this repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **New Algorithm Implementations**: Added sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort) that enhance the existing collection.
- **Code Refactoring**: Improved the readability of existing code with better variable names and comments.
- **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced the README with clearer usage instructions and examples.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**

```python
def sort(arr):
    # Incomplete sorting logic
    pass
```

**After:**

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the Merge Sort algorithm."""
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i = j = k = 0
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```

## Breaking Changes

- The `sort` function has been replaced with a more comprehensive `merge_sort` function. If you were using the previous `sort` function, please update your code to utilize the new implementation.
  
## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the tests using the provided test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests/
   ```

3. Verify that all tests pass and that the new sorting algorithms function as expected.

   ```bash
   python -c "from sorting import merge_sort; print(merge_sort([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]))"
   ```
