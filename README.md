## Features
- A comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Solutions and explanations for each problem.
- A collaborative environment welcoming contributions from the community. ðŸŽ‰

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the `README.md` file has been enhanced with clearer instructions and additional information. The changes include:
- **Added a section for "Example usage"** to provide better clarity on how to utilize the code.
- **Improved the installation instructions** to include a step for navigating into the cloned directory and installing dependencies.
- **Revised the usage instructions** to encourage exploration of the repository and contribution.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
# Install dependencies if any
```

## Example Usage
Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how to compute the nth Fibonacci number:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Returns the nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 3
```
