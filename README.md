The main focus of the changes is to improve the overall structure and readability of the documentation, making it easier for developers to navigate through the project and understand its purpose. Additionally, the update includes code examples that demonstrate the usage of algorithms and data structures, helping new users grasp the concepts more quickly.

Furthermore, we have added a section detailing breaking changes and how they affect existing implementations. This will ensure that contributors are aware of any modifications that might disrupt their current workflows. The changes aim to foster a better understanding of the repository's contents and encourage more contributions from the community.

## Highlights

- Enhanced README structure for improved readability
- Added code examples demonstrating key algorithms
- Included a breaking changes section to inform users of significant updates

### Changes Made

- **Improved Documentation**: Restructured the README to provide a clearer overview and better navigation.
- **Code Examples**: Added examples for common data structures and algorithms.
  
  **Before**:
  ```plaintext
  Implement a binary search algorithm.
  ```

  **After**:
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while left <= right:
          mid = left + (right - left) // 2
          if arr[mid] == target:
              return mid
          elif arr[mid] < target:
              left = mid + 1
          else:
              right = mid - 1
      return -1
  ```

## Breaking Changes

- The format of the algorithm examples has been standardized. If you are referencing previous examples, please ensure they conform to the new structure.
- The naming conventions for some functions have been updated to enhance clarity and uniformity.

## How to Test

To ensure that everything is functioning as expected, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

3. Verify that all tests pass without errors.

4. Check the README for accurate and clear examples. You can do this by reviewing the updated sections and running the provided code snippets.
