# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant enhancements to the README.md file for the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal of this update is to improve clarity and provide more comprehensive information to users. By refining the structure and content of the README, we aim to facilitate easier navigation and better understanding of the repository's purpose and usage. 

In addition to enhancing the documentation, we have also included more examples and clearer instructions for users to engage with the project effectively. This will help both new and experienced developers to better utilize the available data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions, fostering a more collaborative and educational environment.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now follows a more logical flow, making it easier to find information.
- **Enhanced Examples**: More code snippets have been added to illustrate the usage of different data structures and algorithms.
- **Clearer Instructions**: We refined the "How to Test" section to provide step-by-step guidance for running tests.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
## Usage
You can run the questions.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Usage

To run a specific question, use the following command:
```bash
python run_question.py --question <question_name>
```
This command will execute the solution for the specified question.
```

## Breaking Changes

- The command structure for executing questions has been modified. Users will now need to specify the question name when running the script. Please update any scripts or automation that rely on the previous command format.

## How to Test

To ensure that everything is functioning correctly after the update, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Execute a sample question to verify the updated command structure:
   ```bash
   python run_question.py --question example_question
   ```

By following these steps, you can confirm that the changes have been implemented correctly and that the repository is functioning as expected.
