# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have improved the README.md file to enhance clarity and provide a more structured overview of the project. The changes include a more detailed introduction to the repository, clearer navigation for users, and an updated list of features. This aims to make it easier for contributors and users to understand the purpose of the project and how to effectively utilize it.

Additionally, we have included more comprehensive examples of data structures and algorithms, providing before-and-after scenarios to demonstrate the functionality of the implemented solutions. This should aid users in grasping the concepts and applying them in their own projects. 

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Introduction**: The introduction now provides a clearer context for the repository, outlining its purpose and scope.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Added before-and-after examples for selected algorithms, making it easier to understand the application of each solution.
- **Structured Navigation**: Organized sections for easier access to different types of questions and solutions.

### Before / After Examples

**Before:**

```python
# Example of a simple sort function
def simple_sort(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```

**After:**

```python
# Example of a sorting function with improved performance
def optimized_sort(arr):
    # Using Timsort for better average performance
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: x)
```

In the updated example, we switched to a more efficient sorting method, showing how performance can be improved in real-world applications.

## Breaking Changes

No breaking changes were introduced in this update. All previous functionality remains intact, ensuring backward compatibility for existing users.
