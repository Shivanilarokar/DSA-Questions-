This update to the DSA Questions repository primarily focuses on enhancing the documentation in the `README.md` file to provide clearer guidance and improved usability for developers and contributors. The changes aim to streamline the onboarding process for new users and improve the overall structure of the README, making it easier to navigate and understand the purpose and functionality of the repository.

In addition to improved documentation, we have also added examples to illustrate common data structures and algorithms, showcasing their usage and expected outputs. This not only aids in comprehension but also serves as a quick reference for users looking to implement similar solutions in their projects.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved clarity and structure of the README for better user experience.
- **Code Examples**: Added practical examples of data structures and algorithms to illustrate their usage.
- **Updated Contribution Guidelines**: Clarified how contributors can get involved and the process for submitting changes.

## Data Structures

### Linked List
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next. 

**Example:**
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

head = Node(1)
second = Node(2)
head.next = second
```

### Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root.

**Example:**
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

root = TreeNode(10)
root.left = TreeNode(5)
root.right = TreeNode(15)
```
```

## Breaking Changes
