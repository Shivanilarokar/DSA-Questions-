# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README file of the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal was to enhance clarity and provide a more structured overview of the project, making it easier for new contributors and users to understand the purpose and usage of the repository. We have also included additional examples and a more detailed "How to test" section, which outlines the steps necessary to verify the functionality of the implemented data structures and algorithms.

Moreover, we've refined the language and formatting to ensure consistency and readability throughout the document. This will help to foster a more welcoming and informative environment for both developers and learners who wish to engage with the content.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now follows a clearer format with distinct sections for summary, highlights, examples, and testing instructions.
- **Enhanced Clarity**: Language has been simplified to ensure that explanations are straightforward and accessible.
- **Code Examples**: Small before-and-after code snippets have been added to illustrate key concepts and demonstrate usage.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(f"The sum is: {result}")  # Output: The sum is: 8
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function names have been standardized to improve clarity. For example, `add` was changed to `add_numbers` to better reflect its purpose.
- Ensure that any references to the old function names in your projects are updated to maintain compatibility.

## How to Test

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have the required libraries installed. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   Execute the test suite to verify that everything is functioning correctly:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. **Check Output**:
   Ensure that all tests pass and review the output for any discrepancies. If any tests fail, please check the code for the latest changes.
