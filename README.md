# DSA-Questions

## Summary

This update introduces significant enhancements to the `DSA-Questions` repository, focusing on improving the structure and clarity of the README file. The goal is to provide a more user-friendly experience for developers and contributors, making it easier to understand the purpose of the repository, the types of questions included, and how to contribute effectively. 

Additionally, we've streamlined the examples provided in the README to give a clearer picture of how to implement the data structures and algorithms discussed within the repository. This not only aids in comprehension but also serves as a quick reference guide for users looking to navigate through the various questions and solutions available.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The README has been reorganized for better readability, with clear sections for introduction, usage, examples, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Enhanced code snippets that illustrate key concepts and algorithms, making it easier for users to grasp the implementations.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Added a dedicated section outlining how contributors can get involved, report issues, and submit pull requests.

### Before and After Code Examples

#### Before:

- Binary Search
- Linked Lists
```

#### After:

## Key Topics Covered

- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
    ```python
    def binary_search(arr, target):
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if arr[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif arr[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return -1
    ```

- **Linked Lists**: A linear data structure where each element is a separate object.
    ```python
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value
            self.next = None
    ```

## Breaking Changes
