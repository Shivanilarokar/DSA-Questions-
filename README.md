## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the `README.md` to improve clarity, usability, and provide more detailed instructions for contributors and users. The main focus was to streamline the information flow and add examples that illustrate how to effectively use the data structures and algorithms provided in this repository. Clear guidelines on contributing, testing, and understanding the project's structure have also been included to foster a welcoming environment for new contributors.

Additionally, we've made minor formatting adjustments to improve readability, ensuring that the documentation is as informative as possible. By providing concrete examples and a structured approach to testing, we aim to reduce the learning curve for users and contributors alike.

## Highlights of the Update

- Improved structure of the README for better navigation.
- Added clear examples showcasing the usage of key data structures and algorithms.
- Enhanced instructions for testing and contributing.
- Updated formatting for enhanced visual clarity.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
Usage of algorithms is shown in the code.
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Example: Binary Search

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
This function performs a binary search on a sorted array to find the index of the target value.
```
