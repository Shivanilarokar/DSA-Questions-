## Features
- A comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Solutions and explanations for each problem.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and structure. The following changes were made:
- Added a dedicated "Features" section to highlight the offerings of the repository.
- Improved the installation instructions for better clarity.
- Revised the usage examples to provide a clearer demonstration of the Fibonacci function.
- Added a friendly closing note to encourage contributions.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
You can use the implemented algorithms directly from the repository. Below is an example of the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
