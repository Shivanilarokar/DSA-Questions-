Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to help you enhance your coding skills.

## Features
- A comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Solutions and explanations for each problem.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide better examples:
- Added a dedicated **Features** section to highlight the repository's capabilities.
- Improved the language for navigating the project directory after cloning.
- Updated the example code to include a specific DSA problem solution (Fibonacci sequence).
- Enhanced overall readability and structure of the README.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Once cloned, navigate to the repository directory and explore the DSA problems and their solutions.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to get started with the problems:

```python
# Example of a simple DSA problem solution
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```

Feel free to explore the problems and contribute to the repository. Happy coding! ðŸš€
