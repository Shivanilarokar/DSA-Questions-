## Summary of Changes

In this update, the `README.md` has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide better guidance for users and contributors. The changes focus on refining the structure, adding detailed explanations, and including usage examples for clarity. This aims to make it easier for new users to understand the purpose of this repository and how to effectively engage with the content.

Additionally, the update introduces a section on breaking changes, ensuring that users are aware of any modifications that may affect their existing implementations. This transparency is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience and facilitating a seamless transition to the updated repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity in descriptions of data structures and algorithms.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to demonstrate how to implement key algorithms.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: Introduced a dedicated section to outline any significant changes that may affect current users.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clearer guidelines on how to test the implemented algorithms.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before

```markdown
## Sorting Algorithms
This section contains sorting algorithms.
```

#### After

```markdown
## Sorting Algorithms

This section contains various sorting algorithms, including:
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Merge Sort**

### Example: Bubble Sort

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- Updated the function signatures for several algorithms to improve consistency. Ensure to check the `algorithm_name.py` files for the latest parameters.
- Removed deprecated algorithms that are no longer efficient or relevant.

## How to Test

To test the algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Validate the output against the expected results to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
