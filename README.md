Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions. It serves as a resource for developers and students to learn and improve their coding skills.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems categorized by type, with clear and concise implementations in Python. It serves as a learning resource for those looking to enhance their understanding of algorithms.

## Features
- A wide variety of DSA problems.
- Detailed solutions with sample inputs and outputs.
- Easy navigation through different folders for each problem.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest commit, the README.md file has been updated to improve clarity and presentation. The following changes were made:
- Updated the title from "DSA Questions" to "DSA Questions Repository".
- Removed some outdated instructions to streamline the setup process.

### Key Changes
```markdown
- Updated title for clarity
- Streamlined cloning instructions
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Explore the various folders for different DSA problems and their respective solutions. Each problem includes sample inputs and outputs, along with the implementation details.

## Example
Here's a simple example of a binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

Feel free to contribute by submitting issues or pull requests! Your input can help improve the collection of DSA problems and solutions for everyone.
