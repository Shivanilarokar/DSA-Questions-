  # Example sorting algorithm usage
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
      return arr

  sample_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
  sorted_array = bubble_sort(sample_array)
  print("Sorted array is:", sorted_array)
  ```

## Usage
Here’s how you can use one of the algorithms from the repository:

```python
# Example sorting algorithm usage
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

sample_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_array = bubble_sort(sample_array)
print("Sorted array is:", sorted_array)
```
