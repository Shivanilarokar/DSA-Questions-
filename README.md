Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project aims to provide a collection of data structures and algorithms problems with clear solutions and explanations.

## Features
- A wide variety of DSA problems.
- Clear and concise explanations of algorithms.
- Improved code readability with structured examples.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we have made significant improvements to the `README.md` file to enhance clarity and provide a better example of the binary search algorithm. Here are the key changes:

- Updated the header emoji from ðŸ“˜ to ðŸ“œ for better representation.
- Enhanced the descriptions under the **Features** section for improved clarity.
- Refined the example code for the binary search algorithm for better readability.

### Example of Updated Binary Search Code
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1  # Target not found
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and start exploring the problems and solutions. Each problem is documented with its corresponding solution.

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the algorithms directly in your Python environment. Each algorithm is organized in separate files for ease of access and understanding.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the binary search function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
result = binary_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element found at index {result}.")
else:
    print("Element not found in array.")
```

Feel free to contribute to the repository and enhance the collection of data structures and algorithms solutions!
