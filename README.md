# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces significant improvements to the README file, enhancing clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The changes aim to provide a more structured overview of the repository, outline the key features, and present clear examples and testing instructions. By improving the documentation, we hope to make it easier for developers to engage with the project and understand how to contribute effectively.

The revised README includes a detailed summary of the repository's purpose, highlights of the key features and functionalities, and small before-and-after code examples to illustrate the changes made. This effort is part of our ongoing commitment to maintain high-quality documentation that supports an active open-source community.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README has been reorganized for better readability.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Added before-and-after code snippets to clarify changes and usage.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clearer steps on how to test the repository have been included.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

#### After
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```
In the updated version, type hints have been added to improve code clarity and enforce better practices.

## Breaking Changes

- The function `add` now requires type annotations for its parameters and return type. Ensure your code is updated accordingly to adhere to this new standard.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Check the output to ensure all tests pass. If any tests fail, review the code for compliance with the new changes.
