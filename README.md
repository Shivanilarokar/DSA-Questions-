# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have significantly enhanced the README file to provide clearer guidance and better organization for users and contributors. The revisions aim to make it easier for newcomers to understand the purpose of this repository, the structure of the codebase, and how to contribute effectively. Additionally, we've improved the formatting and added examples to illustrate the usage of various data structures and algorithms covered in this repository.

The changes also include a refined section on testing procedures, ensuring that developers can quickly verify their contributions and maintain code quality. Overall, these updates enhance the usability of the repository, making it a more valuable resource for both learning and collaboration.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The README is now organized into clear sections, making it easier to navigate.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: We added concise examples demonstrating the implementation of key data structures and algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section detailing how to run tests has been included, streamlining the process for contributors.

### Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Old Example
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved Example with Explanation
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n."""
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
    return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n - 1)
```
