## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces several enhancements aimed at improving usability and clarity for contributors and users alike. The README file has been revised to provide clearer instructions, better organization of content, and to ensure that all relevant information is easily accessible. These changes are part of our ongoing effort to maintain a high-quality open-source project that effectively supports learning and practicing data structures and algorithms.

In addition to restructuring the README, we've added more comprehensive examples to illustrate the implementation of various data structures and algorithms. This will help users not only understand the concepts but also see practical applications in code. The changes also include the addition of a "How to Test" section, ensuring that contributors can easily verify their implementations and modifications.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now follows a more logical flow, making it easier for new users to navigate the content.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Code snippets have been added to demonstrate the use of key data structures and algorithms.
- **Testing Guidelines**: A new section detailing how to run tests has been included, streamlining the contribution process for developers.
