The **DSA Questions** repository provides a structured approach to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It is designed to help learners and developers enhance their problem-solving skills through a comprehensive collection of DSA problems and solutions.

## Features âœ¨
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems and solutions.
- Solutions provided in multiple programming languages.
- Clear explanations and structured learning paths.
- Regular updates with new problems and solutions.

## Summary of the Changes ðŸ“œ
In this update, the following changes were made to the `README.md` file:
- **Badges** were added to display repository size, contributors, and open issues.
- An **Overview** section was introduced to provide better context about the repository.
- The **Example Code** section was enhanced with an updated Fibonacci function that improves the handling of edge cases.

## Installation ðŸš€
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage ðŸ“–
You can explore various DSA problems and their solutions by navigating through the repository structure.

## Example Code ðŸ§©
Here is the updated Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

This updated function improves the handling of edge cases, ensuring that it returns the correct Fibonacci number for inputs of 0 and 1.
