## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant enhancements to the README.md file to improve clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The improvements include a more structured layout, detailed descriptions of the project's objectives, and clearer instructions for getting started. These changes aim to facilitate a better understanding of the project, making it easier for new contributors to engage with the codebase and for users to comprehend the functionality offered.

Additionally, we have added code examples to illustrate the usage of various data structures and algorithms implemented in this repository. This helps in bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications, allowing users to grasp the functionality more intuitively.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now has a clearer layout, making it easier for users to navigate through sections.
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Each section has been expanded to provide comprehensive information about the project's purpose and goals.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to demonstrate the implementation of specific data structures and algorithms.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA-Questions
This repo contains various DSA questions.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA-Questions

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data structure and algorithm (DSA) questions along with their solutions implemented in various programming languages.

## Objectives
- To provide a comprehensive set of questions for practice.
- To help users learn and understand DSA concepts through practical implementation.

## Example Code
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- No breaking changes have been introduced in this update. The changes are strictly improvements to documentation and do not affect the underlying codebase or its functionality.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this update, simply clone the repository and navigate to the `README.md` file. Review the new structure and examples to ensure they align with the intended enhancements. You can also run any of the DSA implementations to verify that the code snippets are functioning correctly. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
cd DSA-Questions
# Review the README.md
# Run any example code
