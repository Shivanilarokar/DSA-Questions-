```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        # Check if target is present at mid
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        # If target is greater, ignore left half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        # If target is smaller, ignore right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    return -1
```

Feel free to modify and adapt the examples to suit your learning needs!
