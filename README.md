# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the existing documentation within the `README.md` file. The primary focus has been to improve clarity and provide better guidance for contributors and users alike. By refining the structure and content, we aim to make it easier for newcomers to understand the purpose of the project and how to effectively contribute to it.

The changes include a clearer project overview, a more detailed explanation of how to set up the development environment, and improved examples showcasing how to utilize the various data structures and algorithms implemented in the repository. This not only helps users get started quickly but also encourages more contributions by providing a welcoming and informative environment.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Project Overview**: The introduction section now succinctly describes the purpose of the repository and its relevance to data structure and algorithm learning.
  
- **Enhanced Setup Instructions**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment have been added, making it easier for contributors to get started.

- **Code Examples**: Updated code snippets illustrate how to use the algorithms with real-world examples, improving understanding and usability.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**

## Usage

To use the implemented algorithms, you can do the following:

```python
from dsa_questions import quicksort

data = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
sorted_data = quicksort(data)
print(sorted_data)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]
```
```
