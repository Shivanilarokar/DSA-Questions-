### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions
This repo contains data structures and algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions Repository

Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repo contains an extensive collection of data structures and algorithms, organized in a way that helps both beginners and experienced developers understand and implement various concepts effectively.

## Code Snippet Example
To illustrate the use of a binary search, see the example below:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes
