# DSA Questions 📚

Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for practicing and enhancing your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills.

## Overview 🌟
This repository contains a collection of DSA questions along with their solutions. It is designed to help developers and learners improve their problem-solving abilities and understand fundamental concepts in algorithms and data structures.

## Features 🚀
- A variety of DSA questions categorized by difficulty.
- Solutions provided for each question to enhance understanding.
- Clear documentation to assist with learning.

## Summary of the Changes 📝
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Addition of a new **Features** section for improved organization.

### Example Code Snippet
Here's an improved example of a Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
