### Problem Structure
Here's a sample problem structure to illustrate how you can document your DSA problems effectively:

```markdown
### Problem Title
- **Description**: Brief description of the problem.
- **Input**: Specify the input format.
- **Output**: Specify the output format.
- **Example**: Provide an example input/output.
```

## Example
Consider the following example to see how a problem can be structured:

```markdown
### Two Sum
- **Description**: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
- **Input**: An array of integers and a target integer.
- **Output**: Indices of the two numbers.
- **Example**: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, return [0, 1].
