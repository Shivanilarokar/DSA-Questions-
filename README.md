Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems aimed at helping developers enhance their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Overview
The DSA Questions repository aims to help developers improve their coding skills and understanding of fundamental concepts through a comprehensive collection of DSA problems.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Well-structured code for better understanding.
- Easy to contribute.

## Summary of Changes
In this update, the `README.md` file has been streamlined by removing redundant sample code snippets to enhance clarity and focus on essential information.

### Changes Made:
- Removed the sample Python code for an example DSA problem to simplify the README.

```diff
-Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
-```python
-    def example_function():
-        # Your code here
-        pass
-
-    example_function()
-```
```

## Installation
