# DSA-Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes
This update introduces significant improvements to the documentation of the DSA-Questions repository. The README file has been refined to provide clearer guidance on the project's purpose, usage, and contribution process. We have included comprehensive examples and enhanced the structure for better readability, enabling users and contributors to quickly understand the repository's functionality and how to get involved.

Additionally, we have emphasized the importance of maintaining clean and efficient code in our data structures and algorithms. This includes clarifying coding standards and best practices that contributors should follow when submitting their solutions. The new format aims to foster a collaborative environment where developers can easily share their knowledge and improve their coding skills through practical examples.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes detailed sections on getting started, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Added before-and-after code examples to illustrate improvements and best practices.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions on how to contribute to the project, including coding standards and testing procedures.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of a and b."""
    return a + b
```
The updated example now includes type hints and a docstring, improving code readability and maintainability.
