def example_solution():
    # Your solution logic here
    print("Running example solution...")

example_solution()
```

## Example 🔍
Here is a quick example of how to utilize one of the DSA solutions provided in this repository:

```python
# Example usage of a sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Running the bubble sort function
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print("Sorted array:", sorted_array)
```
