## Summary
This repository contains a collection of data structure and algorithm questions.

## Code Example
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The previous format of the README was simplified into distinct sections, which may require users to adjust to the new layout.
