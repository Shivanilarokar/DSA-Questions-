# DSA Questions

## Summary

This update to the `DSA Questions` repository introduces a more structured and user-friendly README, enhancing the overall documentation experience for developers and contributors. The changes made aim to clarify the purpose of the project, outline its functionality, and provide clear instructions on how to interact with the codebase. By improving the README, we hope to foster greater collaboration and make it easier for newcomers to get started with data structures and algorithms practice.

Additionally, we have included a detailed list of changes made, which includes examples of code snippets that demonstrate the functionality of various algorithms. This will serve as a quick reference for users looking to understand how to implement specific solutions using the provided resources.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README has been reorganized for better readability and flow. Sections are clearly defined, making it easier to find relevant information.
- **Code Examples**: Relevant code snippets have been added to illustrate how to use the provided algorithms effectively.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section has been added to guide users on how to run tests, ensuring that contributors can easily verify their changes.

### Code Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating the algorithms included in this repository:

**Before:**
```python
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
```

**After:**
```python
def quicksort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the QuickSort algorithm."""
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)

# Example usage
sorted_array = quicksort([3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Breaking Changes

No breaking changes were introduced in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, ensuring backward compatibility for current users.
