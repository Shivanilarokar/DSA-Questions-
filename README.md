## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant improvements to the README.md file to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The primary goal was to provide a more structured overview of the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions available in this repository. We have reorganized the content to make it easier to navigate, ensuring that both beginners and experienced developers can find the information they need quickly.

Additionally, we've added examples of common DSA questions and their solutions, making it easier for users to understand the problem-solving approach. This change aligns with our commitment to fostering a collaborative learning environment where contributors can easily engage with the material and contribute their solutions.

## Highlights of Changes

1. **Improved Structure**: The README now features a clearer hierarchy with headings and subheadings, making it easier to skim for relevant information.
2. **Added Code Examples**: We've included small code snippets to illustrate solutions to common DSA problems, aiding comprehension.
3. **Enhanced Testing Instructions**: The 'How to Test' section has been expanded to provide detailed steps for verifying contributions.
