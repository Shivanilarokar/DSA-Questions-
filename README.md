### Code Snippet Changes
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_seq = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
    return fib_seq

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Installation
