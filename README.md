```

## Usage
Explore the various DSA problems and their solutions. Below is an example of how to use the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
