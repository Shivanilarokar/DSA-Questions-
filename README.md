- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- üñ•Ô∏è **User-friendly interface for learning**

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide additional examples. The following changes were made:
- Added a new section for a sample Python function demonstrating a DSA question.
- Included an example of the Fibonacci function with an explanation of its output.
- Minor formatting adjustments to improve readability.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository and execute the relevant Python scripts to practice the DSA questions.

## Example
Here's a code snippet demonstrating the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer."
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 34
```
