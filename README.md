# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository focuses on enhancing the clarity and usability of the README file, making it easier for contributors and users to navigate the content. The changes aim to provide a more structured overview of the repository, including clearer instructions on how to run tests, along with examples that demonstrate the functionality of the key features. 

Additionally, the update introduces new sections that highlight important files and breaking changes, ensuring that users are well-informed about the latest modifications and their implications. This will streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and improve collaboration within the community.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: Enhanced organization of sections for better readability.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to illustrate the functionality of specific algorithms.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: Clearly outlined breaking changes to inform users about significant updates.
- **Testing Instructions**: Detailed steps on how to run tests effectively.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```plaintext
To run the algorithms, use the command line interface.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Running Algorithms

To execute the algorithms, you can use the command line interface as follows:

```bash
python main.py --algorithm <algorithm_name>
```
Replace `<algorithm_name>` with the desired algorithm, such as `binary_search`.
```

## Breaking Changes

- The interface for the `sort` function has been modified. It now requires an additional parameter for specifying the sorting order. Make sure to update your calls accordingly.

**Before:**
```python
sorted_list = sort(my_list)
```

**After:**
```python
sorted_list = sort(my_list, order='ascending')
```
