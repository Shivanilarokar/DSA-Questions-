## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: The README now includes a clearer project summary, making it easier for users to grasp the purpose and scope of the DSA Questions repository.
- **Enhanced Usage Examples**: New code snippets have been added that demonstrate how to utilize the data structures and algorithms included in the repository.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on testing has been added, guiding users on how to run tests for the implemented solutions.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions
This repo contains some data structures and algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions

## Overview
This repository provides a collection of data structures and algorithms designed to help users understand and implement common DSA problems.

## Features
- Comprehensive coverage of various data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.)
- Algorithm implementations with explanations
- Testing framework to validate solutions

### Example Usage
```python
from dsa import LinkedList

# Create a linked list and add elements
ll = LinkedList()
ll.append(1)
ll.append(2)
ll.append(3)
print(ll)  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The format of code examples has been standardized to provide consistency across the README.
- The project overview has been expanded to include detailed sections on features, setup, and usage.

## How to Test

To test the functionality of the algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
