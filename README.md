# DSA-Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant improvements and clarifications to the README documentation for the DSA-Questions repository. Our goal is to enhance the onboarding experience for new contributors and users by providing clearer instructions, better examples, and a more structured overview of the project. The changes aim to ensure that users can quickly understand how to navigate the repository and utilize the provided data structures and algorithms effectively.

In addition to improved clarity, this update also addresses some common questions and pain points that users have encountered. By refining the content and structure of the README, we hope to foster a more collaborative environment and encourage contributions from the community. This aligns with our overarching mission to make learning data structures and algorithms accessible and engaging for everyone.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Project Overview**: The introduction section has been rewritten to provide a clearer understanding of the repository's purpose and goals.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Code snippets have been added and improved to demonstrate how to use key data structures and algorithms effectively.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: A new section outlines how users can contribute to the project, including coding standards and the process for submitting pull requests.

### Code Examples

#### Before

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

#### After

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """Performs binary search on a sorted array.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of sorted elements.
        target: The element to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target element if found, otherwise -1.
    """
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Breaking Changes

- **Function Signatures**: The function signatures for several algorithms have been updated to include docstrings. This change enhances readability and provides better documentation directly within the code.
- **Repository Structure**: The layout of the repository has been modified slightly to better categorize the algorithms, which may require users to adjust their navigation habits.
