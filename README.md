Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems with clear and structured solutions.

## Overview
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of DSA questions with solutions that help you improve your coding skills and understanding of algorithms.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Clear and structured solutions
- Easy to understand and implement
- Open for contributions from developers and learners alike

## Summary of the Changes ü§ç
Recent updates have been made to enhance the clarity and structure of the README, along with code improvements. Notable changes include:
- Updated the title emoji from üåç to üöÄ.
- Improved the clarity of the overview section.
- Enhanced the Fibonacci function for better accuracy in handling edge cases.
- Added an example code section to demonstrate the Fibonacci function.
- Improved wording in feature descriptions for better readability.
- Streamlined the installation and usage instructions.

## Installation üîß
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage üíª
You can explore various DSA questions and their solutions within this repository. Below is an example of how to use the Fibonacci function implementation:

### Example of Fibonacci Function Implementation
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

This function calculates the Fibonacci number for a given `n`, demonstrating recursion and base case handling.

Feel free to explore the repository, contribute, and improve your coding skills! Happy coding! üòä
