# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
This update introduces significant enhancements to the DSA Questions repository, focusing on improving the overall structure and clarity of the README file. The changes aim to provide better guidance for new users and contributors, ensuring that they can quickly understand the purpose of the repository and how to get started with the provided data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions.

Additionally, we have refined the examples section to include more relevant code snippets that demonstrate the usage of various data structures and algorithms. By providing clear before-and-after examples, users can better grasp the concepts and implementation techniques presented in this repository.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved README Structure**: The README file has been reorganized for better readability and flow, making it easier for users to navigate through different sections.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Updated code examples to reflect best practices and provide clearer insights into implementing various DSAs.
- **Added Section on Contribution Guidelines**: A new section has been added to guide potential contributors on how to get involved and contribute effectively.

### Before/After Code Example

**Before:**
```python
# Function to find the maximum element in a list
def max_element(lst):
    return max(lst)
```

**After:**
```python
# Function to find the maximum element in a list
def max_element(lst):
    if not lst:
        raise ValueError("List cannot be empty")
    return max(lst)
```
*The updated example includes error handling, making the function more robust.*

## Breaking Changes
- The previous implementation of the `max_element` function did not handle empty lists. This update introduces a ValueError to ensure users are aware of this limitation. Existing code using the old function will need to handle this new exception.

## How to Test
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the test suite to ensure everything is functioning as expected:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Check the updated README for new examples and guidelines.
