## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README.md file for the DSA Questions repository. The main goal of these changes is to enhance clarity and usability for users who are looking to navigate the repository and utilize its resources effectively. By providing a more structured format, including sections detailing the purpose of the repository, usage instructions, and examples, we aim to improve the user experience for both beginners and experienced developers.

Additionally, we have added more context around the data structures and algorithms covered in this repository. This includes updated examples that demonstrate the implementation of key concepts. The modifications also address some outdated information, ensuring that all content is relevant and reflects the current state of the project.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Structure**: The README now features distinct sections that make it easier to locate information quickly.
- **Updated Examples**: Code snippets have been refined to ensure they are accurate and provide a better understanding of the implementation.
- **Clarified Purpose**: The introduction has been revised to clearly articulate the goals and benefits of using this repository.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions
Some algorithms and data structures.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions Repository

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in various programming languages. It serves as a resource for learners and developers looking to enhance their understanding of DSA concepts.
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has been completely overhauled. Users accustomed to the previous format may need to familiarize themselves with the new layout to locate specific information.
- Some examples have been updated to reflect best practices in coding standards, which may involve changes in function signatures or usage patterns.

## How to Test

To verify the changes made to the README, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
