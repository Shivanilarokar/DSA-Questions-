## Features
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ✍️ **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- 🗺️ **User-friendly structure for easy navigation**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the following changes have been made to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the Fibonacci function:

- Improved input handling in the Fibonacci function to manage edge cases more effectively.

### Code Changes
Here are some snippets showing the changes made:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    # Improved input handling
    if n <= 0:  # Changed from n == 0 to n <= 0 for better handling of input
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]  # Initializing the Fibonacci sequence
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])  # Append the next Fibonacci number
        return fib_sequence
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, you can start exploring the DSA questions and solutions. Make sure to check the code for any additional usage instructions specific to the solutions provided.

## Example
To use the Fibonacci function, simply call it with the desired number of terms:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
