This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Structured example format for better understanding**

## Summary of the Changes
In the recent update, the README.md file has been modified to enhance clarity and provide a friendly closing message. The following changes were made:
- Added a new section for "Features" to highlight the benefits of the repository.
- Improved the wording for better clarity in the introduction and usage sections.
- Updated the example code snippet for calculating Fibonacci numbers to handle edge cases.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Navigate to the directory and explore the questions and solutions provided. You can contribute by adding your own questions and solutions!

## Example
Here's a sample code snippet for calculating Fibonacci numbers:

```python
# Example of a simple DSA question solution
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Happy coding! üéâ
