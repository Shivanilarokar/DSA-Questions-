# Movie Analyzer

Welcome to the Movie Analyzer project! This Python application allows users to manage a collection of movies, fetch movie data from the OMDb API, analyze ratings, and save/load movie records from a file.

## What's New
- **Added New Classes:**
  - `Movie`: Represents a movie with attributes such as title, year, rating, and genre.
  - `MovieFetcher`: Responsible for fetching movie data from the OMDb API.
  - `MovieAnalyzer`: Core class for managing a collection of movies, analyzing ratings, and handling file operations.

- **New Methods:**
  - `add_movie`: Adds a movie to the collection.
  - `save_to_file`: Saves the current movie collection to a JSON file.
  - `load_from_file`: Loads movies from a JSON file into the collection.
  - `main`: Main function to execute the application.
  - Enhanced `__init__` and `__repr__` methods for the `Movie` class.

- **Removed Functionality:**
  - The function `add(a, b)` has been **deprecated** and removed from the codebase.

## Usage
### Fetch and Analyze Movies
You can utilize the `MovieAnalyzer` class to fetch and analyze movies. Here is an example of how to use the new features in this project:

```python
from baby import MovieAnalyzer, Movie, MovieFetcher

def main():
    # Create an instance of MovieAnalyzer
    analyzer = MovieAnalyzer()

    # Load existing movies
    analyzer.load_from_file()

    # Example to fetch and add movies
    titles = ["Inception", "The Matrix", "The Dark Knight", "Interstellar", "Fight Club"]
    for title in titles:
        data = MovieFetcher.fetch_movie(title)
        if data:  # Only add if movie data is found
            try:
                movie = Movie(
                    title=data["Title"],
                    year=int(data["Year"].split("â€“")[0]),
                    rating=float(data["imdbRating"]),
                    genre=data["Genre"].split(",")[0]
                )
                analyzer.add_movie(movie)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error processing movie {title}: {e}")

    # Print all movies and average rating
    print("All Movies:")
    for m in analyzer.movies:
        print(m)

    print(f"Average Rating: {analyzer.average_rating()}")
    print("Top 3 Rated:")
    for m in analyzer.top_rated(3):
        print(m)

    print("Sci-Fi Movies:")
    for m in analyzer.by_genre("Sci-Fi"):
        print(m)

    # Save the results
    analyzer.save_to_file()
```

### Class and Function Definitions
#### Class: Movie
#### Class: MovieFetcher
```python
def fetch_movie(cls, title: str) -> Dict[str, Any]  # Fetch movie data from OMDb
```
#### Class: MovieAnalyzer

### Deprecated Functions
- The function `def add(a, b):` has been removed from the codebase.

## Logging
The Movie Analyzer uses logging to provide insights into operations. The log data will be saved to `movie_analyzer.log`.
