## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
To use the solutions provided in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Choose a problem from the repository.
2. Implement the solution in your preferred programming environment.
3. Test the solution with provided example inputs.

### Example
Here is a quick example of how to use the `two_sum` function:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i

# Example Usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]  # Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
```
