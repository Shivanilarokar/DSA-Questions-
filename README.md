# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have enhanced the README file for the DSA Questions repository to provide clearer guidance on the project’s structure, usage, and contributions. The changes aim to improve the overall developer experience by making it easier for users to understand how to navigate the codebase and implement the data structures and algorithms presented in this repository.

The updated README includes a more detailed overview of the project, highlights key features, and provides examples to illustrate the usage of various data structures and algorithms. Additionally, we have included a section on breaking changes to ensure that users are aware of any modifications that may impact their existing implementations.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Expanded Project Overview**: A clearer description of the repository's purpose and what users can expect when utilizing the provided data structures and algorithms.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets demonstrating how to use specific data structures, making it easier for users to get started.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: A dedicated section that outlines any significant changes that might affect backward compatibility.

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a before-and-after example showcasing the usage of a basic data structure:

**Before:**
```python
# Example of creating a linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved example of creating a linked list with a method to append nodes
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node
```

## Breaking Changes

- The `LinkedList` class now includes an `append` method, improving usability for adding elements to the list. This change may require users to update their existing implementations if they relied on the previous version without this method.

## How to Test

To test the changes, clone the repository and run the following commands:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the unit tests to ensure everything is functioning as expected:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests/
   ```

Make sure to review the updated README and explore the new examples provided to get a comprehensive understanding of the changes made.
