## Overview
This repository contains various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions to help you practice coding and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Example Usage
Here's a simple example of how to implement a binary search:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
```
