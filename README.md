## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions
- Detailed solutions and explanations
- User-friendly examples for better understanding

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the following changes were made to the `README.md` file:
- Added a new section for a sample DSA question and its solution.
- Improved formatting and structure for better readability.

### New Section Added
Here's an example of the new content added to the README:

### Question: What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a list comprises two items: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

### Solution:
A linked list can be implemented as follows in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and explore the DSA questions!

## Usage
You can navigate through the questions and try to solve them. Each question is accompanied by a detailed explanation and solution to help you understand the concepts better.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to structure a DSA question:

### Question: What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a list comprises two items: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```
