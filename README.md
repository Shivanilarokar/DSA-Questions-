### Code Usage Example

**Before:**
```python
# Example function
def example():
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
# Example function: Fibonacci Sequence
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_seq = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
        return fib_seq

# Usage
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```
