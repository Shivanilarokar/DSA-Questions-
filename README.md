# DSA Questions

## Summary

This update enhances the README documentation for the DSA Questions repository, providing clearer instructions and improved examples to help users navigate through the various data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems. The goal is to make the repository more accessible for both beginners and experienced developers by emphasizing key features and usage guidelines.

In addition to refining the existing content, we have included a new section that outlines common use cases and expected outcomes. This will allow users to better understand the structure of the repository and how to effectively utilize the provided solutions. These enhancements aim to foster a more engaging learning experience and encourage contributions from the community.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: The README now features clearer explanations of the repository's purpose and structure.
- **Enhanced Examples**: We have added before-and-after code snippets to illustrate the application of algorithms and data structures.
- **Common Use Cases**: A new section detailing typical use cases has been introduced to guide users in selecting the appropriate algorithms for their needs.

### Before/After Examples

#### Before

```python
# Sample algorithm implementation
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Implementation
    pass
```

#### After

```python
# Binary Search Implementation
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """Performs binary search on a sorted array."""
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Breaking Changes

- **Function Signature Changes**: Some functions have updated signatures to improve clarity. Please check the individual implementations for details.
- **Deprecated Functions**: Certain older implementations have been marked as deprecated. Users are encouraged to migrate to the new versions for better performance and maintainability.

## How to Test

To ensure everything is functioning correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. Then run the test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

3. **Verify Outputs**:
   Check the output of the tests to confirm that all algorithms are working as expected.
