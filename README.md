# DSA Questions Repository Update

## Summary of Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced to provide clearer guidance on the usage and contribution to the DSA Questions repository. This includes a more structured layout, additional examples, and a dedicated section for breaking changes. These improvements aim to facilitate a better understanding of the project for both newcomers and experienced developers.

The enhancements also include more detailed descriptions of key features and functionalities, making it easier for users to navigate through the various data structures and algorithms covered in this repository. By refining the documentation, we hope to foster a more collaborative environment for contributors and users alike.

## Highlights of the Changes
- **Improved Documentation**: The README now includes a clearer introduction, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples**: Small examples of algorithms have been added to illustrate how to use them effectively.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: A dedicated section has been added to inform users of any significant updates that may affect their usage of the repository.

# DSA Questions Repository

Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project contains a collection of data structure and algorithm questions designed to help you prepare for technical interviews.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive coverage of fundamental data structures
- Example solutions in multiple programming languages
- Community contributions are welcome!

## Code Example
Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of a binary search algorithm in Python:

```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes
- The function signatures for some algorithms have been updated to improve consistency across the repository. For instance, the `binary_search` function now requires a sorted array as input. Ensure to check the updated function definitions before integrating them into your code.

## How to Test
To test the changes in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
3. Run the test cases provided in the `tests` directory:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

Make sure you have all dependencies installed. You can install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
