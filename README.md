## Installation 📦
To clone this repository, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage 💻
Navigate to the cloned directory and run the desired Python scripts to start solving DSA problems.

## Example 🔍
Here is an example of a binary search implementation:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
