## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions Repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions and solutions, aimed at helping developers and students improve their coding skills.

## Features
- A wide variety of DSA questions.
- Solutions in Python for easy understanding.
- Community contributions are welcome!

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we have made a small yet significant enhancement to the Fibonacci function. The README file has been updated to reflect these changes and provide better clarity.

### Updated Code Snippet:
```python
