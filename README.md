# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the **DSA Questions** repository by introducing an improved structure for problem-solving content and better guidelines for contributors. The modifications aim to streamline the user experience by providing clear pathways for finding and solving data structure and algorithm (DSA) problems. In addition to structural changes, we have also improved the formatting of our example solutions to make them easier to read and understand.

We have added sections that outline common problem-solving strategies and tips for tackling DSA questions effectively. This should assist both beginners and experienced developers in navigating the challenges presented in the repository. Furthermore, we have refined the example solutions to ensure consistency in style and clarity, making it easier for contributors to follow suit.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Reorganized Content**: The README now includes dedicated sections for problem categories, contributing guidelines, and frequently asked questions (FAQs).
- **Enhanced Examples**: Code snippets have been updated for improved readability, including syntax highlighting and clearer comments.
- **Contributing Guidelines**: A new section has been added to guide contributors on how to submit their own DSA questions and solutions.

### Example Before and After
