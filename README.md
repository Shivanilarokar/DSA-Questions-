## Usage
To calculate Fibonacci numbers, you can use the `fibonacci` function as shown in the code snippet below:

### Example of Code Snippet
Here is a sample function from the repository:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

### Additional Example
Here is another sample function from the repository:

```python
def sample_function():
    # Sample function implementation
    pass
```
