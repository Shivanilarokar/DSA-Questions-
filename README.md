The goal is to make it easier for contributors and users to understand how to effectively utilize the data structures and algorithms presented in this repository. By improving the documentation, we aim to foster a more engaging and collaborative environment for learners and developers alike.

Additionally, this update includes minor formatting adjustments and the inclusion of more relevant examples that showcase the practical applications of the algorithms. This will not only help users grasp the concepts faster but also provide them with a solid foundation for implementing these algorithms in their own projects.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity in the README to guide users through the repository.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise before-and-after code snippets to illustrate key concepts.
- **Formatting Enhancements**: Updated the layout for better readability, making it easier to navigate through the content.

### Before/After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**After:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using Bubble Sort algorithm."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, and the new examples are designed to complement the current structure of the repository.
