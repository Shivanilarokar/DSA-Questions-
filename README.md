## Overview

The DSA Questions repository offers a comprehensive collection of data structure and algorithm problems for practice and learning.

## Features

- A wide variety of data structure and algorithm problems.
- Well-structured solutions for each problem.
- Easy navigation and contribution guidelines.

## Summary of the Changes

Recent updates to the README.md include:

- Improved the title for better visual appeal.
- Enhanced the section on exploring the repository and contributing solutions.
- Included an example usage of a sorting algorithm with code snippets for clarity.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

Navigate to the directory and explore the various DSA problems available. You can structure your solution as follows:

```python
# Example of a sample solution
def example_solution():
    pass
```

## Usage

Here's how you might use one of the algorithms provided in this repository:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Sample array
sample_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(sample_array)
print("Sorted array is:", sample_array)
```
