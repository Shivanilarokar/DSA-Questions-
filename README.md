# DSA-Questions

## Summary

This update focuses on improving the README.md file of the DSA-Questions repository. We aim to provide clearer guidance and enhance usability for both contributors and users. By restructuring the document, we ensure that important information is readily accessible, making it easier for new users to understand the purpose and functionality of the repository. 

The README now includes concise descriptions of the project, highlights key features, and provides clear before-and-after examples of the data structures and algorithms implemented. This will streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and enhance the overall user experience.

## Highlights

- **Improved Clarity**: Streamlined sections for easier navigation.
- **Before/After Examples**: Clear illustrations of algorithm implementations.
- **Testing Instructions**: Added a dedicated section for testing steps.

## Changes Made

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Revised sections to improve clarity and flow.
- **Added Examples**: Included before-and-after code snippets to illustrate changes and implementations.
- **Testing Instructions**: Provided a clear guide on how to test the code.

### Before/After Example

**Before:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

**After:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): The list of elements to be sorted.
        
    Returns:
        list: The sorted list.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. The improvements made to the README do not affect the functionality of the codebase or any existing implementations.

## How to Test

To ensure everything is functioning as expected, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
