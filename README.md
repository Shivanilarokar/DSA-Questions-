## Summary of Changes ‚öôÔ∏è

In the latest update, the following changes were made:

1. **Updated Header**: The header for the "Summary of Changes" section was enhanced for clarity.
2. **Removed Notebook File**: The `Day1.ipynb` file was removed, which contained initial DSA questions and their explanations.
3. **Added Functionality**: Introduced a new `function.py` file that includes a class for managing a simple bank account. This class provides methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance display.

### Code Snippet

Here‚Äôs a code snippet from the newly added `function.py` file:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited: ‚Çπ{amount}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrawn: ‚Çπ{amount}")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds!")

    def show_balance(self):
        print(f"Account Balance for {self.owner}: ‚Çπ{self.balance}")

# Example of using the class
acc = BankAccount("Shivani", 5000)
acc.deposit(1000)
acc.withdraw(2000)
acc.show_balance()
```
