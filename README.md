Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions. It serves as a resource for developers and students to learn and improve their coding skills.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems categorized by type, with clear and concise implementations in Python. It serves as a learning resource for those looking to enhance their understanding of algorithms.

## Features
- A wide variety of DSA problems.
- Clear and concise code implementations.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of the Changes
Recent updates have been made to improve the clarity and quality of the README file and the example code snippet. The following changes were made:

- **Enhanced Overview**: The project description has been updated to emphasize the categorization of problems and the clarity of implementations.
- **Code Improvement**: The binary search algorithm example has been refactored for better readability and efficiency.

### Code Snippet Changes
Hereâ€™s the updated binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
You can run the Python scripts directly or integrate them into your own projects. Each script is designed to be self-contained and easy to understand.

## Example
Here's how to use the binary search function:

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5
result = binary_search(arr, target)
if result != -1:
    print(f"Element found at index {result}")
else:
    print("Element not found")
```

Feel free to contribute by submitting issues or pull requests! Your input can help improve the collection of DSA problems and solutions for everyone.

Thank you for checking out the DSA Questions repository! Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
