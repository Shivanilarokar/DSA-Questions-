# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the README documentation to provide clearer instructions and examples for users. The primary goal is to improve usability for developers and learners engaging with data structures and algorithms. By refining the content and structure, we aim to facilitate a better understanding of the available resources and how to apply them effectively.

In addition to enhancing the documentation, we have also included small examples that illustrate the implementation of various data structures and algorithms. This will give users a quick reference point and help them grasp the concepts more efficiently. The changes are designed to elevate the overall quality of the repository, making it a more valuable resource for the community.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved clarity and organization of the README content.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise examples for key algorithms and data structures.
- **User Guidance**: Included instructions for contributing and testing, making it easier for users to engage with the project.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
  
  ```python
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
      return arr
  ```

### Searching Algorithms
- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
  
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, x):
      low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while low <= high:
          mid = (low + high) // 2
          if arr[mid] < x:
              low = mid + 1
          elif arr[mid] > x:
              high = mid - 1
          else:
              return mid
      return -1
  ```
