- Solutions provided for better understanding
- Easy to navigate folder structure

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update to the README.md, the following changes were made:
- Updated the header emoji to ðŸš€ to reflect a more dynamic theme.
- Minor formatting improvements for clarity.
- Enhanced the description of the example code by adding "simple" to the phrase "Here's a simple example of a DSA problem solution."
- Modified the example code for the Fibonacci function for better readability and efficiency.

### Code Changes
Here are the specific code snippets that were changed:

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a DSA problem solution
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

**After:**
```python
# Example of a DSA problem solution
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
