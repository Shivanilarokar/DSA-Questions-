# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have enhanced the README file to provide clearer and more comprehensive documentation for contributors and users of the DSA Questions repository. The modifications include an improved project overview, a structured outline of features, and detailed instructions on how to test the repository effectively. These changes aim to streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and ensure that existing users can easily navigate the repository's offerings.

Additionally, we have added a section highlighting the major updates and code examples that showcase the functionality of the data structures and algorithms implemented in this repository. By providing small before-and-after code snippets, we aim to illustrate the practical applications of the algorithms and make it easier for users to understand their usage.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: The README now includes a more structured format with clear sections for features, usage, and testing.
- **Code Examples**: Small code snippets have been added to demonstrate the functionality of key algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section has been created to guide users on how to test the repository effectively.

### Before/After Examples

**Before**: Simple usage example without context
```python
# Example of a sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**After**: Enhanced example with context
```python
# Bubble Sort Implementation
# This function sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm.
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)  # Get the length of the array
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:  # Compare adjacent elements
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]  # Swap if needed
    return arr

# Example usage
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes introduced in this update. The enhancements are fully backward compatible, ensuring that existing functionality remains intact.

## How to Test
