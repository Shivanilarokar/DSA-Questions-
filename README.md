# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the README.md file to provide clearer guidance for users and contributors of the DSA Questions repository. The primary focus of these changes is to improve the usability of the documentation by adding detailed sections that outline the purpose of the repository, the types of data structures and algorithms covered, and instructions for testing the code. Additionally, we have included small code examples to demonstrate how to use the provided solutions effectively.

The goal of these updates is to make it easier for new contributors to understand the repository's structure, the coding standards used, and how to run tests. By improving the documentation, we aim to foster a more collaborative environment and encourage more developers to engage with the project.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Added a comprehensive overview of the repository and its objectives.
- **Code Examples**: Included small code snippets to illustrate the usage of algorithms and data structures.
- **Testing Instructions**: Provided clear steps on how to run tests and validate the implementations.

### Code Examples

Here are a couple of examples demonstrating how to use the data structures and algorithms included in the repository:

**Before:**
```python
# Example of implementation without documentation
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved implementation with documentation
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Perform binary search on a sorted array.

    :param arr: List of sorted elements
    :param target: Element to search for
    :return: Index of target if found, else -1
    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes introduced in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, and the new documentation is designed to enhance the current user experience without altering the codebase's fundamental behavior.

## How to Test

To test the implementations in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Verify that all tests pass successfully.
