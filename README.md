## Features ‚ú®
- Extensive collection of DSA problems
- Organized by topics for easy access
- Clear installation and usage instructions
- Contribution guide for collaborative enhancement

## Summary of the Changes üìù
In this update, we've made minor adjustments to the README file to improve clarity and formatting:
- Enhanced the description of the repository's focus.
- Updated the wording in the features section for better accessibility.
- Adjusted the heading levels for the "Example" section for consistency.

## Installation üöÄ
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

After cloning, navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage üíª
Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to use the updated Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_seq = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
        return fib_seq

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
