### Example

Here‚Äôs a simple example function demonstrating how you might solve a common DSA problem:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```
