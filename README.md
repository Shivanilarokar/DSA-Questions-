Additionally, some examples have been included to illustrate how to use the data structures and algorithms effectively. This helps in providing better context and understanding for users who may not be familiar with the concepts. The modifications also include a dedicated section for testing the changes to ensure that contributors can verify their implementations easily.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README has been restructured for better flow and clarity.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets demonstrating the usage of data structures and algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: Included a clear section detailing how to run tests and validate changes.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before
```plaintext
This repo contains various data structure and algorithms questions.
```

#### After
```markdown
This repository contains a collection of data structure and algorithm questions designed to help users improve their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.
```

### Code Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a binary search algorithm from this repository:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
