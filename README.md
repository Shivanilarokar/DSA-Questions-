## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have enhanced the README.md file to provide clearer guidance and improved structure for users and contributors. Our primary goal is to ensure that both beginners and experienced developers can easily navigate through the repository, understand its purpose, and utilize the resources effectively. By implementing a more organized format, we aim to foster a better community experience and encourage contributions.

Additionally, we have added detailed sections on code examples, breaking changes, and testing procedures to offer a comprehensive understanding of how to work with the data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions provided in this repository. This update not only improves the documentation but also aligns with best practices for open-source projects.

## Highlights of the Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes structured sections that clarify the repository's purpose, installation instructions, and usage examples.
- **Code Examples**: Added relevant code snippets demonstrate how to implement various data structures and algorithms effectively.
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearly outlined any significant changes that could affect existing implementations or usage patterns.
- **Testing Instructions**: Provided a concise guide on how to run tests and validate changes, ensuring contributors can verify their work before submitting.

# DSA Questions

## Overview
This repository provides a collection of data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions aimed at helping developers prepare for coding interviews and improve problem-solving skills.

## Code Example
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes
- The function `old_function_name` has been refactored to `new_function_name`. Ensure that your code is updated accordingly to avoid errors.

## How to Test
