### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Adds two integers and returns the result.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first integer.
    b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the two integers.
    """
    return a + b
```
