# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces several enhancements to the README file, improving clarity and usability for developers and contributors. The changes aim to provide a more structured overview of the project, including better section organization, clear examples, and a straightforward testing guide. By refining the documentation, we hope to facilitate easier navigation and understanding for both new and existing users of the repository.

In addition to the structural improvements, we have also included relevant code snippets that demonstrate the expected usage of the data structures and algorithms discussed within the repository. These examples serve as practical references that can significantly aid in comprehension, making it easier for users to implement solutions to various data structures and algorithms challenges.

## Highlights of the Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README file now has a more organized layout, making it easier to find information.
- **Code Snippets**: Added relevant before-and-after code examples to illustrate the application of concepts.
- **Testing Instructions**: A new section has been added to provide clear steps on how to test the functionality of the code.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a sorting function
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```

**After:**
```python
# Example of a sorting function with logging
def sort_array(arr):
    print("Sorting the array:", arr)
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
    return sorted_arr
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function `sort_array` now includes logging to provide insights during execution. Ensure that any existing implementations that rely on this function handle the additional print statements accordingly.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install any required dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Verify the output for correctness and ensure that all tests pass successfully.
