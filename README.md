### Example Usage

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        self.balance -= amount

    def show_balance(self):
        print(f"Account Balance for {self.owner}: ‚Çπ{self.balance}")

# Example Usage
acc = BankAccount("Shivani", 5000)
acc.deposit(1000)
acc.withdraw(2000)
acc.show_balance()
```
