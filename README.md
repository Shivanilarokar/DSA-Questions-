## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions Repository! This repository serves as a collaborative platform for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and solutions. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you can find a variety of DSA problems to solve and contribute to.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Clear and concise solutions.
- Community contributions are encouraged.
- Regular updates for improved clarity and readability.

## Summary of the Changes âš¡
In this update, the `README.md` file has been enhanced for better readability and clarity. The following changes were made:

### Key Changes:
- Improved the overall description for better engagement.
- Enhanced the example of the Fibonacci function implementation.

### Code Snippet Example
Hereâ€™s an updated implementation of the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to n"""
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    return fib_sequence
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
You can explore various DSA problems and their solutions. To use the Fibonacci function, simply call it with the number of terms you want:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Example
Here's a quick example of how to use the Fibonacci function:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n_terms = 10
    print(fibonacci(n_terms))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

Feel free to contribute to this repository by submitting your own DSA problems or solutions. Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
