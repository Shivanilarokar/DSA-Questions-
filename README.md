# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes
In this update, the README.md has been enhanced to provide clearer instructions and additional context for users looking to leverage the DSA Questions repository. The enhancements include a more structured format, improved code examples, and a dedicated section for breaking changes. These improvements aim to facilitate a better understanding of the repository's purpose and how users can effectively utilize it.

The major highlight of this update is the addition of concise before-and-after examples that illustrate the impact of the changes made in the codebase. This will help users quickly grasp the differences and improvements in functionality. Furthermore, the new format emphasizes clarity and ease of navigation, making it simpler for users to find the information they need.

## Highlights
- Improved README structure for better readability
- Added before/after examples to demonstrate key changes
- Clearly defined breaking changes and migration steps
- Enhanced testing instructions for users

## What Changed and Why
- **Enhanced Structure**: The README now follows a more organized layout, making it easier for users to locate sections.
- **Before/After Examples**: Added code snippets that show the state of the code before the changes and the improved version afterward, allowing users to easily see the benefits of the updates.
  
### Before Example
```python
# Original function
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### After Example
```python
# Improved function with type hints
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```

## Breaking Changes
- The function `add_numbers` now requires type hints. Ensure your calls to this function are updated to include integer inputs.
