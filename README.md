## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Project Overview**: A concise project description has been added to provide context for new users.
- **Key Features Section**: This section outlines the primary functionalities and benefits of using the repository.
- **Code Examples**: Clear before-and-after code snippets demonstrate how to utilize the provided algorithms more effectively.
- **Testing Instructions**: A detailed section on how to run tests has been included, ensuring users can validate their implementations.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**After:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, and new features have been added without altering the current API.
