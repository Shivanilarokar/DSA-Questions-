# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces enhancements to the README documentation, providing clearer guidance on how to navigate the repository and utilize the provided data structures and algorithms (DSA) resources effectively. The changes focus on improving the overall readability and accessibility of the documentation for new users while also highlighting important features that the repository offers.

In addition to the improved documentation, we have made slight adjustments to the code examples to better illustrate the usage of certain algorithms. These changes ensure that users can quickly grasp the concepts and implement them in their own projects. The updated README now serves as a more comprehensive guide to the repository's contents, making it easier for contributors and learners to find the information they need.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The README now has a clearer structure with distinct sections, making it easier to find relevant information.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Code snippets have been refined to provide better clarity and context for users.
- **Added Usage Instructions**: Clear instructions on how to set up and run examples have been included.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a simple sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved example of a simple sorting algorithm with usage
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print("Sorted array:", sorted_array)
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, and the changes primarily focus on documentation and code clarity.
