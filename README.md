## Overview
The DSA Questions repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms problems designed to help developers enhance their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. This repository includes solutions in various programming languages, covering a wide range of topics.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Multiple programming languages supported
- Clear and concise code examples
- Community-driven contributions

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Added a rocket emoji to the repository title for a more engaging appearance.
- Included a brief description of the `two_sum` function to clarify its purpose and usage.
- Improved formatting and clarity of the overall content.

## Code Changes
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    result = two_sum(nums, target)
    print(result)  # Output: [0, 1] since nums[0] + nums[1] equals target
# This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, navigate to the desired solution file and run the code using your preferred programming language environment.

## Example
Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to use the `two_sum` function:
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1] since nums[0] + nums[1] equals target
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
