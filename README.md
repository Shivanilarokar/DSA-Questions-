## Overview

Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project contains a collection of Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) problems to help developers improve their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Features

- A wide range of DSA problems categorized by difficulty.
- Example solutions provided for various problems.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of Changes

In the latest update, we have added an example code snippet to demonstrate how to structure a solution for a DSA problem. This change enhances the clarity of the README and provides a helpful reference for users.

### Changes Made:
- **Added an example code snippet** to illustrate a typical solution format.

```python
def example_solution():
    # Example code for a DSA problem
    print("This is an example solution!")
```

## Installation

To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start solving DSA problems. Hereâ€™s an example of how to implement a solution:

```python
def example_solution():
    # Example code for a DSA problem
    print("This is an example solution!")
```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of a DSA problem:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```
