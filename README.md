# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
In this update, we have made significant improvements to the documentation within the `README.md` file, enhancing clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The changes focus on providing a more structured format, including sections that summarize the repositoryâ€™s purpose, highlight its features, and clearly outline the contribution process.

Additionally, we've introduced small code examples to help users quickly understand the implementation of various data structures and algorithms. This will facilitate easier navigation and comprehension for both beginners and experienced developers looking to delve into data structures and algorithms (DSA).

## Highlights of Changes
- **Enhanced Documentation**: The `README.md` now contains a clearer structure with dedicated sections for summaries, features, and code examples.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise code snippets demonstrating key algorithms and data structures, making it easier for users to grasp concepts quickly.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Improved instructions for contributing to the repository, ensuring that new contributors can follow the process without confusion.

### Before and After Code Examples

## Overview
This repository contains a curated collection of Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) questions aimed at helping developers enhance their problem-solving skills.

## Example: Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes
- The structure of the `README.md` has been significantly altered, which may affect links or references to specific sections. Ensure that any internal links are updated to reflect the new structure.

## How to Test
To verify that the updates are functioning as intended, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
3. Open the `README.md` file in your favorite Markdown viewer or editor.
4. Review the new sections, ensuring that all links work correctly and that examples are clear and executable.
5. If you have Python installed, you can run the provided code examples to confirm they execute without errors.
