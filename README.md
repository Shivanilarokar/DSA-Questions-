## Example
### Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has undergone significant changes to improve readability and accessibility. Users familiar with the previous version may need to adjust to the new format but will benefit from the enhanced clarity and organization.
