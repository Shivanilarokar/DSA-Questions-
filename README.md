## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to enhance your coding skills and deepen your understanding of various algorithms. 

## Features
- A wide array of DSA problems with detailed implementations.
- Clear and concise code snippets for better understanding.
- Easy navigation and contribution guidelines.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the `README.md` file has been streamlined to enhance clarity and improve the presentation of code snippets. The following changes were made:

- Improved formatting of code snippets for better readability.
- Added clearer distinctions between "Before" and "After" code examples.
- Enhanced the installation and usage instructions for better user experience.
- Updated the contribution section to encourage community involvement.

### Code Snippet Changes
Here's an example of how the code snippets were modified for clarity:

**Before:**
```diff
--Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
--```python
---    def example_function():
---        # Your code here
---        pass
---    example_function()
```

**After:**
```diff
--Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
- ```python
+---def example_function():
+---    # Your code here
+---    pass
+++    example_function()
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the command:
