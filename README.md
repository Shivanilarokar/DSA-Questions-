You can then explore the various DSA problems and their solutions.

## Usage
Here's a sample solution for the Fibonacci sequence problem:

```python
# Example of a simple DSA problem solution
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
```
