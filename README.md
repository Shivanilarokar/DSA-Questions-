## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant enhancements to the README.md file to improve clarity and usability for developers and users engaging with our DSA Questions repository. The primary goal was to streamline the documentation, making it easier to navigate and understand the purpose of the repository, as well as the implementation details of algorithms and data structures. 

Additionally, we have included small code examples that illustrate how to utilize specific functions and solve common problems. This aims to provide immediate value to users and encourage them to engage with our repository more actively. By refining the content and structure of the README, we hope to enhance the overall onboarding experience for new contributors.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: Organized the README into clear sections for better readability.
- **Code Examples**: Added practical examples to demonstrate the usage of key algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: Included a dedicated section on how to run tests for the codebase.

# DSA Questions

Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project contains a collection of algorithms and data structures to help you enhance your coding skills. 

## Key Algorithms
1. **Binary Search**
   - **Usage**: Efficiently finds an element in a sorted array.
   - **Example**:
   ```python
   def binary_search(arr, target):
       low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
       while low <= high:
           mid = (low + high) // 2
           if arr[mid] == target:
               return mid
           elif arr[mid] < target:
               low = mid + 1
           else:
               high = mid - 1
       return -1
   ```

2. **Merge Sort**
   - **Usage**: A sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back.
   - **Example**:
   ```python
   def merge_sort(arr):
       if len(arr) <= 1:
           return arr
       mid = len(arr) // 2
       left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
       right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
       return merge(left, right)

   def merge(left, right):
       sorted_arr = []
       while left and right:
           if left[0] < right[0]:
               sorted_arr.append(left.pop(0))
           else:
               sorted_arr.append(right.pop(0))
       sorted_arr.extend(left or right)
       return sorted_arr
   ```
