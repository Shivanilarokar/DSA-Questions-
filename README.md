Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) questions with clear and structured solutions.

## Overview
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of DSA questions with solutions that help you improve your coding skills and understanding of algorithms.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Clear and structured solutions
- Open for contributions from developers and learners alike

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced with:
- Added badges for GitHub Issues, Forks, and Stars to improve visibility and engagement.
- Introduced an **Overview** section for better understanding of the repository's purpose.
- Expanded the **Example** section to provide a clearer demonstration of the Fibonacci function implementation.

## Installation ðŸ”§
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

You can explore various DSA questions and their solutions within this repository.

### Example of Fibonacci Function Implementation
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function calculates the Fibonacci number for a given `n`, demonstrating recursion and base case handling.

Feel free to explore the repository, contribute, and improve your coding skills! Happy coding! ðŸ˜Ž
