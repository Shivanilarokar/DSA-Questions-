# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces enhancements to the README documentation for the DSA Questions repository, improving clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The changes reflect a more structured approach to presenting information, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the purpose of the repository. Additionally, we have incorporated examples and a clearer description of the projectâ€™s functionalities.

The primary goal of this update is to ensure that both new and experienced developers can quickly grasp the goals of the repository and the significance of the provided algorithms and data structures. By highlighting key features and offering clear code examples, we aim to foster an inclusive environment that encourages collaboration and contribution.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure:** The README now features a more logical flow, guiding users through the project setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Code Examples:** We added succinct code snippets to illustrate the implementation of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions:** A clear section on how to run tests has been included to streamline the development process.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a simple algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**After:**
```python
# Bubble Sort Implementation
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example Usage
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

## Breaking Changes

- No breaking changes were introduced in this update. All existing functionalities remain intact, ensuring backward compatibility.

## How to Test
