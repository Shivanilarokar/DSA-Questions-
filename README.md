## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
To get started with this repository, simply clone it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage üìù
You can navigate through the various folders to find specific DSA problems and their respective solutions. Here‚Äôs an example of how to use the `two_sum` function:

### Example
Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to utilize the `two_sum` function:

```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

def two_sum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]

result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1] since nums[0] + nums[1] equals target
```
