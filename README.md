## Summary
This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in various programming languages. 

## Key Features
- Comprehensive coverage of data structures and algorithms.
- Easy to understand and implement examples.

## Usage Example
```python
# Example of a simple binary search algorithm
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes
- The README now includes more detailed instructions for setting up the development environment.
- The formatting of code examples has been standardized to improve readability.
