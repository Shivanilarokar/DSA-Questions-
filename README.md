# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary

This update to the README.md file enhances the clarity and structure of the documentation, making it more user-friendly for developers and contributors. Clear explanations and organized sections have been introduced to facilitate better understanding of the project and its components. This change aims to streamline the onboarding process for new users and improve the overall accessibility of the repository.

The updated README includes a new section on breaking changes, providing transparency about significant modifications that could affect existing implementations. Additionally, small code examples have been added to illustrate usage patterns and help users quickly grasp the functionality of key components.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Clarity**: Enhanced explanations for each section, making it easier for newcomers to understand the project.
- **Breaking Changes**: A new section detailing any breaking changes implemented in recent commits.
- **Code Examples**: Small snippets to demonstrate key functionalities and usage scenarios.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before

```markdown
## Usage
Some usage instructions.
```

#### After

```markdown
## Usage Examples

To illustrate the functionality, here are some basic usage examples:

### Example 1: Basic Implementation

```python
from dsa import DataStructure

ds = DataStructure()
ds.insert(5)
print(ds.retrieve())  # Output: 5
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- **Function Signature Update**: The `insert` method now requires a second parameter, `overwrite`, which determines if existing values should be replaced. This change was made to enhance the flexibility of the data structure.

### Example of Breaking Change

#### Before

```python
ds.insert(5)
```

#### After

```python
ds.insert(5, overwrite=True)
```

## How to Test
