## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions and their solutions in various programming languages.

## Features
- A comprehensive list of DSA questions.
- Sample implementations for each question.
- Contribution guidelines for adding new questions.

## Example
Here is a simple example of a binary search algorithm in Python:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```
