## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems, along with well-documented solutions to aid understanding.

## Features
- A wide range of DSA problems.
- Well-structured solutions with clear explanations.
- Easy to follow installation and usage instructions.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced for better clarity and structure:
- Improved the introduction for better understanding.
- Updated the installation instructions for clarity.
- Provided an example usage of the Fibonacci function, including expected output.

### Code Changes
Here's a snippet of the updated code reflecting the changes made:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_seq = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_seq.append(fib_seq[i-1] + fib_seq[i-2])
    return fib_seq
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Navigate through the different folders to explore various DSA problems and their solutions.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how to use the Fibonacci function defined in this repository:

```python
result = fibonacci(10)
print(result)  # Expected Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
