# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README file of the DSA Questions repository. The new version aims to provide clearer guidance for users and contributors, enhancing the overall understanding of the project. This includes a structured format that highlights key features, usage instructions, and testing procedures, making it easier for users to get started with the Data Structures and Algorithms questions available in this repository.

Additionally, we have streamlined the examples section to better illustrate how to implement specific algorithms. By providing concise before-and-after examples, we aim to clarify the practical application of the data structures and algorithms discussed in the repository. This change reflects our commitment to improving user experience and accessibility.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: Organized sections for better readability.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Added small code snippets to demonstrate the usage of algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clearer steps on how to run tests for the codebase.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before

```python
# Example code without explanation
def example_algorithm(data):
    # Process data
    pass
```

#### After

```python
# Example code with clear explanation
def example_algorithm(data):
    """
    This function processes the input data and returns the result.
    
    :param data: List of integers
    :return: Processed result
    """
    # Actual processing logic here
    return [x * 2 for x in data]
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function signatures have been updated to include detailed docstrings. Ensure that any existing implementation calling these functions is updated accordingly to match the new definitions.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Review the test results to ensure all tests pass successfully.
