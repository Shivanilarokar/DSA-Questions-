# Project Title

This project provides a set of tools for developers to streamline their workflows. It includes functions for data processing, API interaction, and more.

## What's New

- Added two new functions:
  - `process_data(input_list: List[int]) -> int`: Processes a list of integers and returns a single integer result.
  - `fetch_data(url: str) -> dict`: Fetches JSON data from the specified URL and returns it as a dictionary.
- The following functions have been removed and should no longer be used:
  - `old_function`: This function was replaced by `process_data`.

## Installation

To install this project, use the following command:

```bash
pip install project-title
```

## Usage Examples

### Using `process_data`

Here is an example of how to use the `process_data` function:

```python
from project import process_data

result = process_data([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(result)  # Output will be the processed integer result
```

### Using `fetch_data`

Fetch data from an API endpoint:

```python
from project import fetch_data

data = fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data")
print(data)  # Output will be the JSON data fetched from the URL
```

## API Documentation

### `process_data(input_list: List[int]) -> int`

Processes a list of integers and returns a single integer result.

**Parameters:**
- `input_list` (List[int]): A list of integers to be processed.

**Returns:**
- `int`: The processed integer result.

**Usage Example:**

```python
result = process_data([1, 2, 3])
print(result)  # Output will depend on the implementation of process_data
```

### `fetch_data(url: str) -> dict`

Fetches JSON data from the specified URL and returns it as a dictionary.

**Parameters:**
- `url` (str): The URL from which to fetch data.

**Returns:**
- `dict`: The JSON data fetched from the URL.

**Usage Example:**

```python
data = fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data")
