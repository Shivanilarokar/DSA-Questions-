Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- üöÄ **Efficient algorithm implementations**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Addition of a new features section for improved organization.
- Updated the code snippet for a simple DSA question solution using the Fibonacci sequence for better clarity and performance.

### Example Code Snippet
Here‚Äôs a revised example of how to implement the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
```
