## Overview
Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project aims to provide a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions to help you enhance your coding skills. This repository is designed for developers and learners who are interested in improving their understanding of data structures and algorithms. It contains various problems explained in a clear and concise manner.

## Features
- A wide variety of DSA problems.
- Clear and concise explanations of algorithms.
- Improved code readability with structured examples.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we have made significant improvements to the `README.md` file to enhance clarity and provide a better example of the binary search algorithm. Here are the key changes:
- Enhanced the overall structure of the README to maintain professionalism and clarity.
- Updated the example of the binary search algorithm with improved code readability.

### Updated Example of Binary Search Algorithm
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return -1
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the algorithms directly in your Python environment. Each algorithm is organized in separate files for ease of access and understanding.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the binary search function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
result = binary_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element found at index {result}.")
else:
    print("Element not found in array.")
```
