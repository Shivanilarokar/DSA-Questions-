Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to help you enhance your coding skills.

## Features
- A comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Solutions and explanations for each problem.
- Collaborative environment for contributors to improve and expand the repository. ðŸŽ‰

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide additional information:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight the repository's offerings.
- Enhanced the example section with a specific implementation of the Fibonacci function.
- Improved wording for installation instructions.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the Fibonacci function from the repository:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
