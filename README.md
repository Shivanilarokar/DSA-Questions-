git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and explore the various DSA questions and their solutions. You can run any solution locally or contribute by adding more questions.

## Example
Here’s a simple example of how to implement a basic function for a DSA question:

```python
# Example Python Code for a DSA Question
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
