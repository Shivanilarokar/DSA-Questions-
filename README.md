# DSA Questions

## Summary

In this update, we've made significant enhancements to the `README.md` file to provide clearer guidance for users and contributors. The revised documentation now includes a comprehensive overview of the project, a structured format for code examples, and a detailed explanation of the project's purpose and usage. These enhancements aim to improve the onboarding experience for new developers and facilitate contributions from the community.

In addition to the textual improvements, we've also streamlined the formatting of code snippets, making it easier for users to understand the algorithm implementations. This clarity will ensure that users can quickly grasp the logic behind the data structures and algorithms presented in this repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Project Overview**: The introduction now provides a clearer explanation of the goals and structure of the repository.
- **Code Examples**: We've added more structured and formatted code examples to demonstrate the usage of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Contributing Guidelines**: A section has been added to outline how new contributors can get involved and submit their own questions or solutions.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def quicksort(arr):
    # Quick sort algorithm implementation
    ...
```

**After:**
```python
def quicksort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the Quick Sort algorithm."""
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
```

## Breaking Changes

No breaking changes were introduced in this update. All existing functionalities remain intact, and users can upgrade without any adjustments to their implementation.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this update, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
3. Review the updated `README.md` file for the new structure and examples.
4. Run the existing test suite to ensure that all algorithms function as expected:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```
