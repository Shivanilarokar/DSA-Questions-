Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**

## Summary of the Changes
The README.md file has been updated to reflect the latest enhancements in the repository:
- Added a dedicated **Features** section to highlight the repository's offerings.
- Improved wording in the **Usage** section to encourage contributions.
- Included an **Example** section with a sample implementation of the binary search algorithm.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
# Include any installation commands if necessary
```

## Usage
Explore the collection of DSA questions and solutions. Feel free to contribute by adding your own solutions or improving existing ones!

### Example: Binary Search Implementation
Here is a simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in Python:

```python
# Example of a simple DSA implementation
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance your DSA skills with this repository!
