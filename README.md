## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide additional information:
- Added a new section for features.
- Enhanced the example section with a specific implementation of the Fibonacci function.
- Improved wording for installation instructions.

## Installation

cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
You can navigate through the repository to find various DSA problems and their corresponding solutions.

### Example
Here is a specific implementation of the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
