# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
This update introduces significant enhancements to the README file, providing a clearer overview of the project, its purpose, and how users can effectively engage with the content. The revised documentation ensures that both new and experienced contributors can easily navigate the repository and understand the structure of the project. Additionally, it aims to streamline the onboarding process for developers looking to contribute to data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions.

The changes include an improved layout, more detailed sections on how to contribute, a clearer explanation of the project's goals, and an enhanced code example section that demonstrates the usage of various data structures and algorithms. By making these adjustments, we hope to foster a more collaborative environment and encourage community involvement.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Project Overview**: The introduction now succinctly describes the purpose of the repository, which is to provide a collection of DSA questions for practice and learning.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Added a section that outlines how users can contribute to the repository, making it easier for newcomers to get involved.
- **Code Examples**: Enhanced examples of DSA implementations, showcasing both the problem statement and the solution in a clear manner.

### Before and After Code Example
**Before:**
```python
# Example of a simple linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```

**After:**
```python
# Example of a simple linked list with a method to append a new node
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node
```

## Breaking Changes
There are no breaking changes in this update. The repository structure and existing functionalities remain intact, ensuring that users can continue to use the repository without any interruptions.

## How to Test
To verify the changes made in the README and to ensure that the code examples work as intended, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
3. Test the code examples by running the Python scripts in your local environment and ensuring that they execute without errors.

4. Review the updated README to familiarize yourself with the new structure and guidelines.
