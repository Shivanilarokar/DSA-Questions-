# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository includes significant enhancements to the README documentation, providing clearer instructions and improved organization. The changes aim to facilitate a better understanding of the repositoryâ€™s structure and content, making it easier for contributors and users to navigate the available data structures and algorithms.

In particular, the README now features a more detailed overview of the various data structures and algorithm questions available, along with examples to illustrate their usage. This will help users quickly identify relevant questions and understand how to implement solutions effectively.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes a structured breakdown of sections, making it easier to find information.
- **Improved Examples**: Each algorithm and data structure now has accompanying code snippets to demonstrate their implementation.
- **Clearer Setup Instructions**: Instructions for setting up the project locally have been clarified to ensure a smoother onboarding experience for new contributors.

### Before and After Example

**Before:**
```markdown
## Data Structures
- Array
- Linked List
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Data Structures
- **Array**
  - A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```
- **Linked List**
  - A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each pointing to the next.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value
            self.next = None
    ```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing functionalities remain intact, and the new documentation does not alter any code or APIs. 

## How to Test
