## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of data structures and algorithms questions that help you enhance your coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Well-commented code for better understanding.
- Examples and explanations for each algorithm.
- Contributions are welcome!

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest commit, the following changes were made to the `README.md` file:
- Updated the title emoji for better aesthetics.
- Minor changes to the comments in the binary search function for clarity.
- Added a motivational message at the end of the README to encourage users.

### Code Snippet Changes
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Check if target is present at mid
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    # If target is greater, ignore left half
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        left = mid + 1
    # If target is smaller, ignore right half
    else:
        right = mid - 1

    return -1
```

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository and run any of the provided algorithms in your preferred Python environment.

## Example
Here‚Äôs an updated example of the binary search algorithm:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        # Check if target is present at mid
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
            
    return -1
```

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and enhance your understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms! üöÄ
