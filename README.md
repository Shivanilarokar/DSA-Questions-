- Refined the example code to improve clarity and accuracy in the Fibonacci function.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

You can start practicing with the DSA questions by navigating to the respective directories.

## Usage
Explore the various DSA questions and their solutions. Each question is designed to help you practice and understand different concepts in data structures and algorithms.

## Example
Here’s an example of a simple Python function demonstrating a common algorithm:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2])
    return fib_sequence
```

This function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number, showcasing a practical application of recursion and iteration.
