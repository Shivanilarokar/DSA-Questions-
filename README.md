# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
In this update, we have made significant enhancements to the README.md file to improve clarity and usability for contributors and users of the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal of these changes is to provide a more structured overview of the repository, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose of the project, the features it offers, and how to contribute effectively.

The revised README includes detailed sections on project highlights, code examples, and a clear outline of breaking changes. This structured documentation aims to streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and facilitate a better understanding of the codebase for existing contributors.

## Highlights
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved clarity and organization of the README to better guide users and contributors.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise examples illustrating how to use various data structures and algorithms.
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearly documented any breaking changes to ensure developers are aware of the updates and can adjust their implementations accordingly.

### Code Examples
Before:
```python
def example_function():
    # Some code
    pass
```

After:
```python
def example_function(data):
    """
    Processes the input data and returns the result.
    
    Parameters:
        data (list): A list of integers to process.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of processed integers.
    """
    return [x * 2 for x in data]
```

## Breaking Changes
- The function `example_function` now requires a parameter `data`, which must be a list of integers. This change was made to enhance the function's usability and clarity.
