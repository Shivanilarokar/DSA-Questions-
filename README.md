# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces several enhancements to the README.md file, providing clearer guidance and improved documentation for users. The changes aim to facilitate a better understanding of the project structure, usage, and contribution guidelines, making it easier for new contributors to get started. 

Additionally, we have included more comprehensive examples to illustrate key algorithms and data structures covered in the repository. This will help users quickly grasp the concepts and apply them effectively in their own projects. The overall aim is to ensure that the repository is user-friendly and informative, enhancing the learning experience for all.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced explanations for various data structures and algorithms.
- **Code Examples**: Added succinct before-and-after code snippets to demonstrate usage.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clearer instructions on how to contribute to the repository effectively.

### Code Examples

**Before:**

```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    # Implementation here
```

**After:**

```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    """Perform binary search on a sorted array."""
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
