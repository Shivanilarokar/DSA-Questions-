# DSA Questions

## Summary

This update enhances the `README.md` file to provide clearer guidance on using the DSA Questions repository. It includes detailed sections on installation, usage, and contributions, making it easier for new users to get started and for contributors to understand the project's structure. The aim is to create a more intuitive onboarding experience for developers and learners alike, ensuring they can quickly find the information they need.

In addition to restructuring the content, we've added examples for common data structures and algorithms included in the repository. This will help users visualize how to implement these algorithms effectively. The documentation now also highlights the testing framework used, making it easier for developers to run tests and contribute changes confidently.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation:** The `README.md` has been reorganized for better clarity.
- **Code Examples Added:** Small code snippets for key algorithms demonstrate their usage.
- **Installation Instructions:** Clear steps for setting up the environment and running the code.
- **Contribution Guidelines:** Enhanced section to guide potential contributors through the process.

### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to implement a simple binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```

### Before and After

**Before:**
- Sparse instructions and examples, making it difficult to navigate.

**After:**
- Well-organized sections with clear examples and a straightforward guide for new users.

## Breaking Changes
