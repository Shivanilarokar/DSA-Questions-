```

## Usage

To use the functions provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
   ```
2. Open the desired Python file.
3. Call the functions with the appropriate parameters.

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the `two_sum` function:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]

# Example input
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]  # Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
```
