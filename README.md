# DSA Questions

## Summary

This update introduces a series of enhancements and optimizations to the DSA Questions repository, aimed at improving usability and performance. The README has been revised to provide clearer instructions for users and contributors, ensuring a smoother experience when navigating the repository. Additionally, code snippets and examples have been updated to reflect recent changes, making it easier for developers to understand the implementation of various data structures and algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Updated Examples**: Code snippets have been revised for clarity and conciseness. This includes both before and after comparisons to illustrate the improvements.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README now includes additional explanations for setup and usage, making it more accessible for newcomers.
- **Performance Improvements**: Some algorithms have been optimized to enhance performance, which is reflected in the updated examples.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

#### After

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break
    return arr
```

The updated implementation introduces a `swapped` flag to terminate the loop early if no swaps are made, improving the overall efficiency of the algorithm.

## Breaking Changes

- The `bubble_sort` function now includes an early exit condition, which may alter the expected behavior if the previous version relied on the function completing all iterations regardless of the state of the array. Ensure your implementation accounts for this change.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this update, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests/
   ```

3. Verify the output matches the expected results. You may also want to test the performance of the updated algorithms with various input sizes to observe the improvements.
