## Overview
The DSA Questions repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms problems aimed at helping developers improve their coding skills. This repository serves as a valuable resource for practicing coding problems and preparing for technical interviews.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Solutions in Python üêç
- Well-documented code and examples
- Community-driven contributions ü§ù

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and readability. Key changes include:
- Improved phrasing in various sections for a more professional tone.
- Enhanced example usage for the `two_sum` function.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
You can explore the various DSA problems and their solutions in the repository. Here's a quick example of how to use the `two_sum` function:

### Example Usage
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

Feel free to contribute by adding more problems or improving existing solutions!
