## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- üöÄ **Efficient algorithm implementations**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Added a dedicated **Features** section for better visibility.
- Added a dedicated **Installation** section to facilitate easier setup.
- Improved the example code for the Fibonacci function, showcasing a more efficient iterative approach.
- Updated the code snippet for a simple DSA question solution using the Fibonacci sequence for better clarity and performance.

### Example Code Snippet
Here‚Äôs a revised example of how to implement the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
```
