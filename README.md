# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces significant improvements to the README file, enhancing clarity and user engagement. The changes aim to provide better guidance for users navigating the repository, making it easier for both newcomers and seasoned developers to understand the project's structure and purpose. We've streamlined the content, ensuring that essential information is readily accessible and the overall aesthetic is appealing.

In addition, we've added small code examples to illustrate key concepts and functionalities, enabling users to grasp the practical applications of the data structures and algorithms discussed. This will not only serve as a quick reference but also as a practical guide for implementing solutions. 

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Clarity**: The README now offers a more structured format with clear headings and sections, improving the overall readability.
- **Code Examples**: Small before/after code snippets have been incorporated to demonstrate how specific algorithms can be implemented, providing practical insights.
- **Testing Instructions**: A new section detailing how to test the functionalities has been included, ensuring that users can verify their implementations easily.

### Before/After Code Example

**Before:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**After:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm.
    
    :param arr: List of elements to be sorted.
    :return: Sorted list.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
