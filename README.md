## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the README file to provide clearer guidance on the project's purpose, usage, and contribution guidelines. The changes include a more structured format, improved examples, and additional sections that aim to facilitate better understanding and engagement from users and contributors alike. By refining the documentation, we aim to foster a welcoming environment for both novice and experienced developers interested in data structures and algorithms.

In addition to the structural updates, we've added small code examples to illustrate how users can interact with the repository. These examples not only showcase the functionality available but also serve as a practical reference for those looking to implement their own solutions or contribute to the project effectively. Overall, these enhancements are intended to improve the usability and accessibility of the repository for all stakeholders.
