# Project Title

## Introduction

Welcome to the *Project Title* repository! This project aims to provide comprehensive solutions for [brief description of what the project does]. 

## What's New

As of the latest update, we've made significant improvements and added new features to enhance the functionality and usability of the project:

- **New Features:**
  - Introduced `NewFeatureClass` for advanced data processing.
  - Added `performComplexCalculation()` method to `Utilities` class for enhanced mathematical operations.

- **Deprecations:**
  - Removed the `OldFunction()` due to its outdated methodology. Please use `NewFunction()` instead which provides better performance and accuracy.

- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed issues with data validation in the `DataManager` class.

## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash

cd project-title
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### New Examples

Here are some new examples of how to use the latest features:

#### Using `NewFeatureClass`

```python
from project_name import NewFeatureClass

# Create an instance of NewFeatureClass
feature = NewFeatureClass(parameter1, parameter2)

# Call the new method
result = feature.executeFeature()
print(result)
```

#### Performing Complex Calculations with `Utilities`

```python
from project_name import Utilities

# Use the Utilities class for a complex calculation
result = Utilities.performComplexCalculation(value1, value2)
print(f"Result of complex calculation: {result}")
```

## API Documentation

### Classes

- **NewFeatureClass**
  ```python
  class NewFeatureClass:
      def __init__(self, parameter1: Type1, parameter2: Type2):
          pass

      def executeFeature(self) -> ReturnType:
          pass
  ```

- **Utilities**
  ```python
  class Utilities:
      @staticmethod
      def performComplexCalculation(value1: Type1, value2: Type2) -> ReturnType:
          pass
  ```

### Deprecated

- **OldFunction()**
  - **Signature:** 
    ```python
    def OldFunction(param1: Type1) -> ReturnType:
        pass
    ```
  - **Note:** This function has been removed. Use `NewFunction()` instead.
