## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have refined the content of our README.md file to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The changes focus on providing a more structured overview of the repository, including a detailed explanation of the available data structures and algorithms, as well as improved navigation through the content. This aims to facilitate better understanding and ease of access for new developers looking to contribute to this project or utilize the code.

Additionally, we have corrected some formatting issues and updated code examples to be more representative of current best practices. This ensures that users not only learn from the examples but also maintain consistency with modern coding standards. The overall goal is to create a more welcoming and informative environment for all contributors and users of this repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The layout of the README has been revamped for better readability. Sections are now clearly defined with headings, making it easier to locate information.
- **Updated Code Examples**: Several code snippets have been updated to reflect best practices in coding. This includes adopting more modern syntax and techniques.
- **Enhanced Descriptions**: Explanations and descriptions for algorithms and data structures have been expanded to provide more context and understanding.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(0, len(arr)-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**After:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes introduced in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, and the updated examples are backward compatible with prior versions of the code.
