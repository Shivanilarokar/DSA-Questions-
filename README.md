## Overview
The DSA Questions repository is a curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and solutions. This repository aims to help developers and students enhance their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions.
- Well-documented solutions in Python.
- Easy to navigate and understand.

## Summary of the Changes
Recent updates have enhanced the `README.md` file with clearer instructions and examples. Notable changes include:
- **Fibonacci Function Logic Update:** Improved the logic to handle edge cases.
- Added a new example section to demonstrate the Fibonacci function.

### Code Snippet Changes
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:  # Changed from n == 0 to n <= 0
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repo to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git

```

## Usage
Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance the collection of DSA questions and solutions!

## Example: Fibonacci Sequence
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Fibonacci function included in this repository:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
