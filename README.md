# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant enhancements to the README.md file of the DSA Questions repository. The objective of these changes is to provide clearer documentation, improve usability, and establish a more comprehensive overview of the available data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions. This will greatly assist both new and experienced developers in navigating the repository and understanding the scope of its content.

The updated README now includes structured sections that highlight key features, a more detailed summary of the repository's purpose, and examples that demonstrate how to effectively utilize the provided code. By implementing these changes, we aim to foster a more engaging and informative experience for users, encouraging contributions and collaboration within the open-source community.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Introduction**: The introduction has been rewritten to better explain the purpose and utility of the repository.
- **Structured Format**: Added sections for features, examples, and contribution guidelines for clarity.
- **Before/After Code Examples**: Incorporated concise code examples to illustrate the usage of data structures and algorithms.

### Before Example
```python
# Old example of a basic data structure
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```

### After Example
```python
# New example with better context
class Node:
    """Represents a node in a linked list."""
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

def create_linked_list(values):
    """Creates a linked list from a list of values."""
    head = Node(values[0])
    current = head
    for value in values[1:]:
        current.next = Node(value)
        current = current.next
    return head
```

## Breaking Changes

- **Refactored Code Examples**: All examples have been updated to follow a more standardized format, which may require users to adjust their implementations if they were relying on the previous structure.
- **New Contribution Guidelines**: Introduced a formalized process for contributions, which may affect how users submit their pull requests moving forward.
