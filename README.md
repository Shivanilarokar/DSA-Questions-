- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to illustrate usage.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Enhanced instructions for contributing to the repository, making it easier for developers to participate.

### Before and After

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions
A repository containing various data structure and algorithm questions.
```

**After:**

## Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a binary search algorithm in Python:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes
