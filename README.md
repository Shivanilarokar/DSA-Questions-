Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of problems and solutions related to data structures and algorithms, designed to help developers enhance their problem-solving skills and understanding of DSA concepts.

## Overview
The DSA Questions repository offers a comprehensive collection of questions covering various algorithms and data structures. This repository serves as a valuable resource for learners and developers looking to enhance their skills in data structures and algorithms.

## Features ‚ú®
- Extensive collection of DSA questions.
- Well-documented solutions with explanations.
- Examples and edge case handling for key algorithms.

## Summary of the Changes üìù
In the latest commit, the following updates were made to the README.md file:
- Improved clarity and professionalism in the repository description.
- Refined the overview section to better highlight the repository's purpose.
- Adjusted the installation and usage section headings for better readability.
- Enhanced the example code snippet for the Fibonacci function, including edge case handling.

### Here are some snippets from the updated README.md:

#### Installation
To install this repository, clone it using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```
Then, navigate into the directory:
```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```
You may need to install any dependencies listed in the documentation.

#### Example Code Snippet
Here is an example of a Fibonacci function implementation:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer"
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```
This function now includes handling for edge cases, ensuring robustness.
