Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- üõ†Ô∏è **User-friendly structure for easy navigation**

## Summary of Changes
In the latest update, the following changes have been made to enhance the clarity and functionality of the code:

- **Added a Features section** to highlight the main offerings of the repository.
- **Variable Naming Update**: The variable `seq` has been renamed to `fib_sequence` for better readability in the Fibonacci function.
- **Code Consistency**: Adjusted the appending logic to use the new variable name, improving clarity and maintainability.

### Code Changes
Here are the specific code changes made:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2])
        
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
cd DSA-Questions-
# Install dependencies (if any)
```

## Usage
You can run the provided scripts in any Python environment. Simply call the functions with the required parameters to see the output.

## Example
To see the Fibonacci sequence for the first 10 numbers, execute the following code:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
