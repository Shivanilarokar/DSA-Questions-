- **Code Snippets**: Added examples to demonstrate the usage of specific algorithms and data structures.
- **Formatting Changes**: Updated headings and lists for better readability.

## Changes Made

- **Documentation Structure**: Reorganized sections for better flow and accessibility.
- **Code Examples**: Included small code snippets for key algorithms, such as sorting and searching.
  
### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
### Sorting Algorithms
We have various sorting algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Sorting Algorithms

#### Quick Sort
```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
```
The Quick Sort algorithm is efficient and commonly used for sorting lists.
```
