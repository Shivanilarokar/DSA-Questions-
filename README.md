## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions and solutions to help you enhance your problem-solving skills.

## Features
- A wide range of DSA problems categorized for easy navigation.
- Code examples provided for better understanding.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of Changes
In this update, the `README.md` file has been refined for clarity and consistency. The following changes were made:
- Enhanced the language for better readability.
- Improved the example section with a more relevant code snippet demonstrating a DSA problem.

### Code Changes:
Here’s an updated code snippet demonstrating a simple DSA problem solution:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
