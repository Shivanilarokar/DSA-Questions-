This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- ‚ö° **Structured example format for better understanding**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README file has been enhanced to improve clarity and usability. The following changes were made:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight the key offerings of the repository.
- Improved the example code snippet for better understanding.
- Enhanced the closing statement to encourage contributions with a friendly tone.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
This repository provides a variety of DSA questions and solutions. You can start exploring the questions and contribute your own solutions.

### Example
Here is a simple example of a DSA question and its solution:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_series = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_series.append(fib_series[i-1] + fib_series[i-2])
    return fib_series

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance your DSA skills! üíª
