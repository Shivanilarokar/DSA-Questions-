# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the clarity and usability of the README file. The primary goal is to provide new contributors and users with a better understanding of the repository's purpose, structure, and how to navigate the various data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems contained within. 

Additionally, we have improved the organization of the content, making it easier to find relevant information. This includes a more detailed description of the project, clearer instructions for contributing, and enhanced examples to demonstrate the implementation of specific algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Project Description**: Clarified the purpose of the repository and the types of DSA problems covered.
- **Enhanced Contribution Guidelines**: Provided clearer instructions on how to contribute to the project, including coding standards and submission processes.
- **Updated Examples**: Added more concise code examples to illustrate key algorithms and their implementations.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # code for binary search
    pass  # This was a placeholder
```

**After:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1  # Target not found
```

## Breaking Changes
There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing code examples and algorithms remain intact and fully functional. However, we encourage users to refer to the updated examples for improved clarity and efficiency.

## How to Test
To test the changes made in this update, clone the repository and run the following commands:

1. Clone the repository:
