# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the clarity and usability of the README file, making it easier for newcomers and contributors to understand the purpose and structure of the repository. By providing clearer sections, improved formatting, and relevant code examples, we aim to create a more engaging experience that encourages contributions and learning. 

The changes also include a more structured layout that highlights important information and guides users on how to effectively use the repository. This aligns with our goal of fostering a community around data structures and algorithms (DSA) practice.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now has sections clearly delineating the purpose of the repository, how to contribute, and how to test the code.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to illustrate how to implement specific data structures and algorithms.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Enhanced formatting for better readability, including bulleted lists, headers, and code blocks.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def example_function():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

**After:**
```python
def example_function() -> str:
    """
    Returns a greeting message.
    
    Returns:
        str: A greeting string.
    """
    return "Hello, World!"
```

In the updated example, we've added type hints and a docstring to improve code readability and usability.
