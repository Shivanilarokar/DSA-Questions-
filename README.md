- **Improved Code Examples**: Added before/after examples for better illustration of concepts.
- **Clear Contribution Guidelines**: Updated instructions on how to contribute, making it easier for new contributors to get involved.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before:

```python
# Example of a basic linked list implementation
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

#### After:

```python
# Improved linked list implementation with methods for adding and removing nodes
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node
```
