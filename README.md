Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions and solutions, aimed at helping developers improve their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Overview

The DSA Questions repository is designed to provide a comprehensive collection of DSA problems, with each problem including a solution, explanations, and examples to help you understand the concepts better.

## Features

- Comprehensive set of DSA problems.
- Clear and concise solutions in Python.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.

## Summary of the Changes

In the latest commit, the `README.md` file has been updated to enhance clarity and usability. Key enhancements include:

- Improved repository description and formatting.
- Updated clone command to include the `.git` extension.
- Code snippet updates for better presentation and clarity.
- Encouragement for contributions focused on problem-solving and documentation improvements.

### Code Snippet Changes

Here's an example of how the code snippets were modified for clarity:

**Before:**
```diff
# Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
def example_function():
    # Your code here
    pass

example_function()
```

**After:**
```python
# Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
def example_function():
    # Your code here
    pass

example_function()
```

## Installation

To set up the repository locally, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
