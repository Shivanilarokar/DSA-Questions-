# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary

This update introduces key enhancements to the DSA Questions repository, aimed at providing a more organized and user-friendly experience for developers and learners alike. The primary focus of this update is to improve the documentation and clarity of the repository, making it easier for users to navigate through various data structure and algorithm questions. Additionally, it includes minor code optimizations and improved examples to better illustrate the concepts.

The changes implemented in this commit reflect a commitment to quality and usability, ensuring that both new and experienced users can efficiently leverage the resources available in this repository. We believe that these improvements will facilitate a more productive learning environment and encourage more contributions from the community.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README has been completely revised to provide clearer instructions and better organization of content.
- **Improved Examples**: Code examples have been refined to demonstrate best practices and clearer logic, making them easier to understand.
- **Consistent Formatting**: All sections have been formatted consistently, improving readability and aesthetic appeal.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(a,b):
    return a+b
```

**After:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```

In the updated example, the function signature now includes type hints and a docstring, enhancing clarity and usability.

## Breaking Changes

- The function `add` now requires type hints. Ensure that all function definitions in your codebase are updated accordingly to maintain compatibility with this standard.
