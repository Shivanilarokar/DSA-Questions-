# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces significant improvements to the README file, enhancing clarity and usability for both new and existing users. The revisions provide a more structured layout, ensuring that essential information is easily accessible. Detailed sections now include a clearer summary of the project, highlights of the key features, and explicit instructions on how to contribute effectively.

Additionally, the README now includes small before-and-after code examples to illustrate the changes made in the codebase. This will help users understand how to implement the data structures and algorithms being discussed. We have also included a dedicated "How to Test" section that outlines the steps necessary to verify the functionality of the code in this repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The README now follows a more logical structure, making it easier to navigate.
- **Code Examples**: Added small before-and-after examples to demonstrate the impact of changes and usage of algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: New section added to guide users on how to test the implementations effectively.

### Before and After Examples

#### Example: Implementing a Binary Search

**Before:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    # implementation here
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function signatures for several algorithms have been updated to enhance consistency across the codebase. Please review your implementations for any necessary adjustments.

## How to Test

To test the changes in this repository, follow these steps:
