## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have enhanced the README file to provide clearer guidance on the repository's purpose, usage, and contribution process. The improvements aim to make the documentation more accessible for new users and contributors, ensuring that they can quickly understand how to navigate the repository and utilize its resources effectively. This update also includes additional examples and a more structured layout to facilitate better comprehension of the data structures and algorithms included in the repository.

One of the key changes is the inclusion of small code snippets demonstrating how to implement specific data structures and algorithms. This will help users grasp the practical applications of the concepts discussed in the repository. Furthermore, we've organized the content to highlight important sections, making it easier for contributors to find relevant information when adding new questions or solutions.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now has a more organized layout with clear headings and subheadings.
- **Code Examples**: Added practical code snippets for better illustration of data structures and algorithms.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Enhanced instructions for contributing to the repository, making it easier for new contributors to get started.

        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node
```
