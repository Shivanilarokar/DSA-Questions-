## Features
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ✍️ **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- 🛠️ **User-friendly structure for easy navigation**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the following changes have been made to enhance the clarity and maintainability of the code:

- **Code Consistency**: Adjusted the appending logic to use a new variable name, improving clarity and maintainability.

### Code Changes
Here are the specific code changes made:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:  # Changed from n == 0 to n <= 0 for better handling of input
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2])
        
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
# Install dependencies (if any)
```

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, you can start exploring the various DSA questions and their solutions. Feel free to contribute by adding more questions or improving existing solutions!

## Example
To see the Fibonacci sequence for the first 10 numbers, you can execute the following code:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
