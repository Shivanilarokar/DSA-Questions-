The revisions include a more organized format, updated examples, and clearer instructions for testing the code. The goal is to provide a concise guide that allows users to quickly understand the purpose of the repository and how to contribute effectively.

In addition to the structural changes, we have refined the code examples to better illustrate the data structures and algorithms presented in the repository. These modifications not only improve readability but also ensure that contributors can easily follow along and implement the solutions provided. 

## Highlights of Changes

- **Updated Code Examples**: Examples have been revised to be more relevant and easier to understand.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clear instructions on how to run tests have been added to facilitate contributions.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Old example of a linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```

**After:**
```python
# Updated example of a linked list with a display method
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

    def display(self):
        print(self.value)
```
