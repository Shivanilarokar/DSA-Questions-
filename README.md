# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have enhanced the README file to provide clearer instructions and better organization of content for users engaging with our Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository. The primary goal is to improve user experience by making it easier to navigate through the available resources, understand the project structure, and quickly find relevant examples and contributions.

We have added new sections including a detailed overview of the project, highlights of recent changes, and a concise guide for testing the repository. This update aims to ensure that both new and existing contributors can effectively utilize the repository and contribute to ongoing development.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Project Overview**: A more informative introduction to the repository, detailing its purpose and the types of algorithms and data structures included.
- **New Test Instructions**: Clear steps for running tests and validating contributions have been added to facilitate easier onboarding for new contributors.
- **Code Examples**: Small before and after code snippets have been included to illustrate the functionality of certain algorithms.

### Before and After Code Example

#### Before
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

#### After
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
*The updated binary search implementation is more efficient with a time complexity of O(log n).*

## Breaking Changes

No breaking changes have been introduced in this update. The repository remains backward compatible with previous versions.

## How to Test

To ensure that the repository functions as expected after this update, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Verify that all tests pass and that the output matches the expected results.
