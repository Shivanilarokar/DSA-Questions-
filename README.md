## Installation ⚙️
To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage 📖
Here’s an example of how to approach a DSA question:

### Example Question: Two Sum
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

**Input:**
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

**Output:**
```python
[0, 1]  # Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
```

### Example Function
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    # Implementation goes here...
```

Feel free to explore the repository, practice the problems, and contribute your solutions!
