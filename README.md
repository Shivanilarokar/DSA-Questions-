## Example
Here's a simple example of how you might structure a question in this repository:

```python
def example_function(data):
    """
    This function takes a list of data and processes it.
    
    Args:
    data (list): A list of data elements to process.

    Returns:
    list: A processed list of data elements.
    """
    # Process the data
    processed_data = [x * 2 for x in data]
    return processed_data
```
