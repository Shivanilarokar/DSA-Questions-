## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the README file to provide clearer documentation and guidance for users. The new structure aims to improve usability for developers and contributors by offering a more organized presentation of information. This includes a succinct summary of the project, key highlights, and detailed examples that illustrate how to use the provided data structures and algorithms effectively.

Additionally, we've included a 'How to test' section to guide contributors through the testing process, ensuring that any new additions or modifications adhere to the expected functionality. This will help maintain the quality and reliability of the codebase as the project evolves.

## Highlights

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity in the README to support users in understanding the purpose and usage of the repository.
- **Code Examples**: Added practical code snippets to illustrate key algorithms and data structures.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clear steps on how to run tests and validate changes, promoting best practices among contributors.

## What Changed

- **README Structure**: The README has been restructured to highlight important sections, making it easier to navigate.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to demonstrate usage. For example:

  ```python
  # Example of a simple binary search algorithm
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while left <= right:
          mid = (left + right) // 2
          if arr[mid] == target:
              return mid
          elif arr[mid] < target:
              left = mid + 1
          else:
              right = mid - 1
      return -1
  ```

- **Testing Section**: Included a 'How to test' section to guide users through the testing process.
