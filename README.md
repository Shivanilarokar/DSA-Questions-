## Summary of Changes
This update to the DSA-Questions repository enhances the overall clarity and usability of the README file. The changes aim to provide clearer instructions for users, improve the structure for easier navigation, and present a more engaging overview of the project. This ensures that both new contributors and users can quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of the repository.

In addition, we've added sections that highlight important features, provide usage examples, and detail the testing steps necessary for verifying the functionality of the data structures and algorithms provided. The goal is to create a more comprehensive resource that encourages contributions and facilitates easier onboarding for new users.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Structure:** The README now features a more logical flow, with sections clearly delineated for quick reference.
- **Code Examples:** Added before-and-after code snippets to illustrate changes and usage.
- **Testing Instructions:** Comprehensive steps for testing the repository have been included to assist developers in validating their implementations.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def example_function(data):
    # Original implementation
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
def example_function(data):
    # Improved implementation with better performance
    return [item * 2 for item in data if item > 0]
```

## Breaking Changes
- The function `example_function` has been refactored to improve performance, which may affect existing implementations that relied on the previous behavior. Please ensure to review the updated logic and adapt your code accordingly.
