## Overview

The DSA Questions repository offers a comprehensive collection of data structure and algorithm problems for practice and learning.

## Features

- 📚 A wide variety of data structure and algorithm problems.
- 🛠️ Well-structured solutions for each problem.
- 📝 Easy navigation and contribution guidelines.

## Summary of the Changes

Recent updates to the README.md include:

- Enhanced the section on exploring the repository and contributing solutions.
- Improved the title for better visual appeal.
- Included an example usage of a sorting algorithm with code snippets for clarity.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory to explore the various DSA problems available. You can run the solutions in a Python environment.

```python
# Example of a sample solution
def example_solution():
    # Your solution code here
    pass
```

## Usage

Here's how you might use one of the algorithms provided in this repository:

```python
# Example usage of a sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Sample array
sample_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(sample_array)
print("Sorted array is:", sample_array)
```
