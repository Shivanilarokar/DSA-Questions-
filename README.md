```

## Usage
Here's a code snippet for a common problem, the "Two Sum":

**Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

**Example Solution**:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
```
