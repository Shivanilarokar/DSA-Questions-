# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the existing README for the DSA Questions repository, providing clearer documentation and better guidance for new users. The changes include additional explanations of the repository's purpose, an overview of the data structures and algorithms covered, and improved examples to demonstrate usage. The aim is to ensure that developers can quickly understand the content and start contributing to this open-source project.

The README now features a more structured layout, making it easier to navigate. Sections have been added to highlight key features and provide clear before-and-after examples of the algorithms implemented within the repository. This will help both novice and experienced developers grasp the fundamental concepts and see the practical applications of the data structures and algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now follows a logical flow with clear headings and subheadings.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Added code snippets that illustrate the use of various algorithms.
- **Clarified Purpose**: The introduction now succinctly describes the objective of the repository.

### Before/After Examples

#### Before

```python
# Example of a sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    # sorting logic
    pass
```

#### After

```python
# Example of a sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
    
    :param arr: List of elements to be sorted.
    :return: Sorted list of elements.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

## Breaking Changes

- Removed outdated examples that no longer reflect best practices.
- Adjusted the format of code examples to follow PEP 8 guidelines for better readability.

## How to Test

To verify the changes made in this update, follow these steps:
