In this latest update, the README.md file has been auto-updated to include a new **Features** section and refined code examples for better clarity. The changes enhance the overall structure and readability of the documentation.

### Notable Changes:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight the repository's offerings.
- Improved the example code snippet to better illustrate function implementation.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and explore the various DSA questions available.

## Usage
This repository provides a structured way to practice DSA questions. You can navigate through the files to find questions and their corresponding solutions.

## Example
Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to implement a basic function for a DSA question:

```python
# Example Python Code for a DSA Question
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Feel free to contribute and enhance this repository with your own DSA questions and solutions!
