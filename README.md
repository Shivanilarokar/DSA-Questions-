In this update, we have made significant enhancements to the structure and content of the README file for the DSA Questions repository. The goal of these changes is to improve clarity, provide essential information upfront, and make it easier for contributors and users to navigate the project. The updated README now includes clearer sections on usage, contribution guidelines, and a more comprehensive overview of the data structures and algorithms covered in the repository.

Additionally, we have included examples of how to implement various data structures and algorithms, which serve as a quick reference for users. This will aid in understanding the practical applications of the concepts discussed in the repository. The changes were made to ensure that both new and experienced developers can quickly find the information they need without sifting through unnecessary details.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now follows a more logical flow, making it easier to find relevant sections.
- **Code Examples**: Small code snippets have been added to illustrate key concepts, enhancing understanding.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions on how to contribute have been outlined to encourage community participation.

### Before and After Examples

This repository contains various data structures and algorithms.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in various programming languages. Each implementation is designed to demonstrate key concepts and functionalities.

## Examples
### Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```
