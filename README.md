## Installation ⚙️

To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage 📝

To utilize the algorithms and data structures provided in this repository, navigate to the specific problem folder and refer to the solution files. Below is an example of how to implement a bubble sort algorithm:

### Example: Bubble Sort Implementation

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
example_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_array = bubble_sort(example_array)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_array)
```
