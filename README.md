# DSA-Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes
This update to the DSA-Questions repository focuses on enhancing the documentation within the `README.md` file. The goal is to provide clearer instructions, better examples, and a more structured overview of the project. With these changes, users will find it easier to understand the purpose of the repository, navigate through the content, and implement the data structures and algorithms covered in the questions.

Additionally, the README has been refined to include sections that highlight key features, breaking changes, and a comprehensive testing guide. This ensures that both new and returning contributors can quickly acclimate to the latest developments and contribute effectively to the project.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity in the description and usage of the repository.
- **Code Examples**: Added succinct code snippets to illustrate the implementation of specific data structures and algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: Provided detailed steps for running tests to ensure code integrity.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
## Data Structures
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Data Structures
### Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each pointing to the next.
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```

### Stack
A stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
```

## Breaking Changes
- The format of the code examples has been standardized to use Python syntax highlighting.
- The section on testing has been restructured for better clarity, including new commands for running tests.
