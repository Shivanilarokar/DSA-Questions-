## Overview
The DSA Questions repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms problems designed to enhance your coding skills and prepare you for technical interviews.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Solutions in Python
- Well-documented code and examples

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and readability. Key changes include:
- Updated badges for better visibility.
- Minor formatting adjustments for a cleaner layout.
- Enhanced example usage for the `two_sum` function.
- Improved phrasing in various sections for a more professional tone.

### Example Usage
Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to use the `two_sum` function:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    result = two_sum(nums, target)
    print(result)  # Output: [0, 1] since nums[0] + nums[1] equals target
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Navigate to the specific problem folder and run the corresponding Python files to see the solutions.
