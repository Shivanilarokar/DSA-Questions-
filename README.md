# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update to the `DSA Questions` repository refines the existing README file to enhance clarity and usability for developers and contributors. It includes a more structured overview of the project, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the resources available. The revisions aim to improve the overall documentation experience, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need to contribute effectively.

The README now better highlights key features of the project and provides clear before-and-after examples of how to implement various data structures and algorithms. Additionally, we have addressed common user queries by adding a dedicated section on how to test the code effectively, ensuring that contributors can validate their changes easily.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now has a cleaner layout with distinct sections for different types of information.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Added more illustrative before-and-after code snippets to demonstrate the application of algorithms.
- **Testing Instructions**: A comprehensive "How to test" section has been included to guide users through validating their contributions.

### Before/After Examples

#### Before
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    # Simple bubble sort implementation
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

#### After
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

## Breaking Changes

- No breaking changes have been introduced in this update. All existing functionalities remain intact, and the new documentation only enhances the clarity of usage.
