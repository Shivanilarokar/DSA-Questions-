# DSA Questions Repository Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces significant improvements to the README file, enhancing clarity and usability for developers and users alike. The primary focus of these changes is to provide a more comprehensive overview of the project, outline clear instructions for usage, and improve the overall aesthetic and structure of the document. As a result, contributors and users will find it easier to navigate the repository and understand the purpose and functionality of the code.

In addition to the structural enhancements, we have included more detailed examples that demonstrate how to effectively use the data structures and algorithms provided in this repository. These examples aim to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation, allowing users to quickly grasp how to apply the algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Overview**: The README now includes a succinct project description to set the context for new users.
- **Detailed Usage Instructions**: Clear steps on how to implement and test the data structures and algorithms.
- **Code Examples**: Added before-and-after code snippets for improved understanding.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def example_function():
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
def example_function(data):
    """Process the input data."""
    return [x * 2 for x in data]

# Example usage
result = example_function([1, 2, 3])
print(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

## Breaking Changes

- The interface for some functions has been modified to improve usability. Ensure to check the function signatures if you are updating from an older version.

## How to Test

To verify that the changes are working as expected, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Review the output to ensure all tests pass successfully.
