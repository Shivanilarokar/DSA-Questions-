In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README file of the DSA-Questions repository. The primary focus was to enhance clarity and provide better guidance for users looking to understand and contribute to the project. The changes include improved structure, clearer examples, and additional context regarding the project's purpose and usage.

We have also added a section to highlight common data structures and algorithms covered in this repository. This aims to help newcomers quickly identify the resources available and facilitate easier navigation through the repository. Overall, these enhancements strive to create a more user-friendly experience, making it easier for developers to engage with the content.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Structure**: The README has been restructured for better readability and flow.
- **Expanded Examples**: Included more illustrative examples to demonstrate the usage of key algorithms.
- **New Sections**: Added a "Common Algorithms" section to list frequently used algorithms and their descriptions.
  
### Before and After Examples
#### Before
```markdown
# DSA Questions
This repo contains questions.
```

#### After
```markdown
# DSA-Questions
A comprehensive collection of data structure and algorithm questions to help you prepare for coding interviews and improve your programming skills.

## Common Algorithms
- **Binary Search**: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
- **Quick Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm that uses divide-and-conquer principles.
```

## Breaking Changes
- The structure of the README has changed significantly, which may affect existing links or references to specific sections. Please ensure that any links to the README are updated to reflect the new structure.

## How to Test
To test the changes made to the README, simply clone the repository and review the README.md file. Ensure that all links are functional and that the examples provided accurately reflect the algorithms and data structures described. You can also run any example code snippets in your local environment to verify correctness.
