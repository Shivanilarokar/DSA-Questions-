# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
In this update, we have improved the clarity and usability of the README file for the DSA Questions repository. The modifications aim to provide better guidance for new contributors and users looking to understand the project's structure and purpose. By enhancing the documentation, we hope to foster a more inclusive environment that encourages collaboration and learning.

Significant changes include the addition of a "Highlights" section that outlines the key features and functionalities of the repository. We also included before-and-after examples to illustrate the impact of our algorithms more clearly. These updates are designed to streamline the onboarding process for new users and enhance their experience as they navigate through the various data structures and algorithms provided.

## Highlights
- **Improved Documentation**: Clearer instructions and explanations for each algorithm.
- **Before/After Examples**: Visual representations of algorithm functionality to aid understanding.
- **Enhanced Usability**: Reorganized sections for better navigation and accessibility.

### Before/After Example

**Before:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # implementation here
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """Performs binary search on a sorted array.

    Args:
        arr (list): A sorted list of elements.
        target (any): The element to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target if found, otherwise -1.
    """
    # implementation here
    pass
```
