# DSA Questions

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces several enhancements and clarifications in the README file to improve user experience and understanding. The changes focus on providing clearer instructions, better organization of content, and improved examples, making it easier for developers and learners to navigate the repository and utilize the resources effectively.

In addition to the structural adjustments, we've included more concise code examples that illustrate the core concepts of data structures and algorithms. This aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, facilitating a smoother learning curve for users ranging from beginners to advanced programmers.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The layout of the README has been refined for better readability and flow, making it easier to locate essential information.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Code snippets have been added to provide clear before-and-after scenarios, showcasing the application of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Clarified Instructions**: The documentation now includes more detailed explanations of how to set up and run the examples, ensuring that users can follow along without confusion.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a basic linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```

**After:**
```python
# Example of a basic linked list with insertion method
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def insert(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node
```

## Breaking Changes

- No breaking changes were introduced in this update; existing functionality remains intact. Users can continue using the repository as before without any modifications to their current implementations.
