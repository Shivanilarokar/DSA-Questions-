## Overview
This repository serves as a collaborative platform for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) enthusiasts. It aims to provide a collection of DSA questions along with their solutions to help learners and developers enhance their coding skills.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Collection:** A variety of DSA questions covering fundamental concepts.
- **Clear Explanations:** Each solution includes detailed explanations to facilitate understanding.
- **Community Driven:** Open for contributions from the community.

## Summary of Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced for better readability and clarity. Additionally, the Fibonacci function has been improved to handle edge cases more effectively.

### Key Changes:
- **Improved Fibonacci Function:**
  - Added checks for edge cases (e.g., when `n` is less than or equal to 0).
  - The function now returns a complete Fibonacci sequence up to `n`.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to n"""
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the updated Fibonacci function:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```
