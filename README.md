   ```

## Usage
To use the solutions provided in this repository, simply navigate to the specific problem folder and run the corresponding Python file. For example:
```bash
python problem_name.py
```

## Example
Here is an example of a DSA question implemented in Python:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
