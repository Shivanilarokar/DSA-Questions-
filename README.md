Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ✍️ **Detailed solutions and explanations**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the following changes have been made to enhance the clarity and maintainability of the code:
- **Code Consistency**: Adjusted the appending logic to use a new variable name, improving clarity and maintainability.

### Code Changes
Here are the specific code changes made:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:  # Changed from n == 0 to n <= 0 for better handling of input
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2])
        
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, you can start exploring the various DSA questions and their solutions. Feel free to contribute by adding more questions or improving existing solutions!

## Example
To see the Fibonacci sequence for the first 10 numbers, you can execute the following code:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
