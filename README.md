## Summary of Changes

In the recent update, we have significantly improved the documentation and organization of the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal of these changes is to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. By refining the README.md file, we aim to provide a more structured approach to understanding the data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions available in this repository.

Additionally, we've added detailed sections that outline the purpose of the repository, how to navigate it, and how to contribute effectively. This update is intended to foster a welcoming environment for both new and experienced developers looking to engage with DSA challenges.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: The README has been restructured to provide clearer navigation and more detailed explanations of the questions.
- **Code Examples**: Small code snippets have been included to illustrate problem-solving techniques.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: A new section has been added to guide potential contributors on how to effectively add questions or solutions.
