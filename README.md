## Features
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ✍️ **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- 🛠️ **User-friendly structure for easy navigation**

## Summary of Changes
In the latest update, the following changes have been made to enhance the clarity and functionality of the code:

- **Added a Features section** to highlight the main offerings of the repository.
- **Variable Naming Update**: The variable `seq` has been renamed to `fib_sequence` for better readability in the Fibonacci function.
- **Code Consistency**: Adjusted the appending logic to use the new variable name, improving clarity and maintainability.

### Code Changes
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2])
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
