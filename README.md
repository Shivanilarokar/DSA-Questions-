# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, the repository's README has been refined to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The modifications aim to provide a more structured overview of the project, including a clearer explanation of its purpose, improved navigation through sections, and updated examples that reflect the latest changes in the codebase. These enhancements are designed to make it easier for new users to get started and for contributors to understand the project's scope and guidelines.

Additionally, we have included a section on breaking changes that may affect existing implementations, ensuring that users are fully informed before upgrading. The README now serves not only as a guide but as a comprehensive resource for troubleshooting and understanding the framework of the data structures and algorithms presented.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Project Overview**: A clearer description of the repository's goals and what users can expect.
- **Updated Code Examples**: Examples have been revised to demonstrate recent changes in the codebase, ensuring they are relevant and accurate.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: A dedicated section to inform users of any significant changes that might affect their current implementations.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**

```python
def example_function():
    pass
```

**After:**

```python
def example_function(data):
    """
    Processes the input data and returns the result.
    
    :param data: List of integers to be processed
    :return: Processed result as an integer
    """
    return sum(data)  # Example of processing the data
```

## Breaking Changes

- The `example_function` now requires a parameter `data` which must be a list of integers. This change is intended to provide more flexibility and clarity in function usage.

## How to Test

To ensure that the changes are functioning as expected, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite to verify that all tests pass:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Manually test the updated functions with sample inputs to ensure they behave as documented.
