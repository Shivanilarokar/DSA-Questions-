# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant enhancements to the README file of the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal was to improve clarity, organization, and accessibility of information for developers and contributors. By refining the structure, we've aimed to provide a more informative and engaging experience for users exploring data structures and algorithms (DSA) resources. 

Additionally, we've added new sections that highlight key features, usage examples, and testing instructions. These changes are intended to streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and facilitate better understanding of the repository's functionality and purpose.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now features a clearer layout with distinct sections for summary, highlights, examples, and tests.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: We've included concise before/after code snippets to demonstrate the application of key concepts.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section has been introduced to guide users through testing the repositoryâ€™s features effectively.

### Before/After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Function to reverse a string
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
```

**After:**
```python
# Function to reverse a string with error handling
def reverse_string(s):
    if not isinstance(s, str):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a string")
    return s[::-1]
```

This change not only improves functionality but also enhances user experience by providing better error feedback.

## Breaking Changes

- The `reverse_string` function now raises a `ValueError` for non-string inputs. This change is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the function and ensuring that users are aware of incorrect usage.

## How to Test

To test the updated functionalities, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Verify that all tests pass and that the updated features function as expected.
