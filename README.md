Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ✍️ **Detailed solutions and explanations**

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and provide additional examples. The following changes were made:
- Added a new section for a sample Python function demonstrating a DSA question.
- Included an example of the Fibonacci function with an explanation of its output.
- Minor formatting adjustments to improve readability.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository and execute the relevant Python scripts to practice the DSA questions.

## Example
Here's a code snippet demonstrating the Fibonacci function:

```python
# Sample Python function to demonstrate a DSA question
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute to enhancing the collection of DSA questions!

Thank you for visiting the **DSA Questions** repository! Happy coding! 🎉
