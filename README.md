# Movie Analyzer

Welcome to the Movie Analyzer project! This Python application allows users to fetch, analyze, and store information about movies. Users can retrieve movie data from an API, evaluate ratings, and categorize their collection based on various criteria.

## What's New

- The following classes have been removed:
  - `Movie`: This class has been deprecated along with its methods.
  - `MovieFetcher`: This class is no longer available.
  - `MovieAnalyzer`: Has been removed with its associated methods for managing movie collections.

- Removed functions:
  - `main()`
  - `__init__(self)`
  - `__repr__(self)`
  - `add_movie(self, movie: Movie)`
  - `save_to_file(self, filename="movies.json")`
  - `load_from_file(self, filename="movies.json")`

- New classes and functions have been introduced to streamline the functionality.

## Overview

The Movie Analyzer is a Python application that helps users interact with movie data efficiently through a set of new features and functionalities.

### Added Classes
- **`Movie`**: Represents a movie with attributes such as `title`, `year`, `rating`, and `genre`.
- **`MovieFetcher`**: Fetches movie data from an external API.
- **`MovieAnalyzer`**: Analyzes the fetched movie data, calculates average ratings, and manages the movie collection.

### Added Functions
- **`__init__(self, title: str, year: int, rating: float, genre: str)`** for `Movie`: Initializes a new movie instance.
- **`__repr__(self)`**: Provides a string representation of the movie.
- **`add_movie(self, movie: Movie)`**: Adds a movie to the analyzer.
- **`save_to_file(self, filename="movies.json")`**: Saves the movie list to a JSON file.
- **`load_from_file(self, filename="movies.json")`**: Loads movie data from a JSON file.

### Example Usage

Below are examples demonstrating how to utilize the new functionality:

#### Create a Movie Instance
```python
movie = Movie(title="Inception", year=2010, rating=8.8, genre="Sci-Fi")
print(movie)
```

#### Create a MovieAnalyzer and Add Movies
```python
analyzer = MovieAnalyzer()
analyzer.add_movie(movie)
```

#### Save Movies to a File
```python
analyzer.save_to_file()
```

#### Load Movies from a File
```python
analyzer.load_from_file()
```

#### Fetch Movies Using MovieFetcher
```python
fetched_data = MovieFetcher.fetch_movie("The Matrix")
if fetched_data:
    matrix_movie = Movie(
        title=fetched_data["Title"],
        year=int(fetched_data["Year"].split("â€“")[0]),
        rating=float(fetched_data["imdbRating"]),
        genre=fetched_data["Genre"].split(",")[0]
    )
    analyzer.add_movie(matrix_movie)
```

#### Calculate Average Rating
```python
average = analyzer.average_rating()
print(f"Average Rating: {average}")
```

#### Get Top-Rated Movies
```python
top_movies = analyzer.top_rated(3)
print("Top 3 Rated Movies:")
for top_movie in top_movies:
    print(top_movie)
```

#### List Sci-Fi Movies
```python
sci_fi_movies = analyzer.by_genre("Sci-Fi")
print("Sci-Fi Movies:")
for sci_fi_movie in sci_fi_movies:
    print(sci_fi_movie)
```
