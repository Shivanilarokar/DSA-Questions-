Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ✍️ **Detailed solutions and explanations**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been improved for clarity and presentation:
- Added a new **Features** section to highlight key aspects of the repository.
- Improved wording for clarity and engagement in various sections.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
The repository contains various algorithms implemented in Python. Here’s an example of a simple bubble sort implementation:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
print(bubble_sort([3, 1, 2]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance your DSA skills! 🎉
