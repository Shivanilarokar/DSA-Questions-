## Overview

The DSA Questions Repository is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions and solutions aimed at helping developers enhance their problem-solving skills. This repository serves as a platform for learning, practicing, and contributing to DSA.

## Features âœ¨
- A variety of DSA questions categorized by difficulty.
- Solutions provided for each question in multiple programming languages.
- Contribution guidelines for adding new questions and solutions.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been modified to improve clarity and visual appeal:
- Enhanced badge visibility with updated styles.
- Revised usage instructions to encourage contributions.
- Updated the example code to showcase a specific solution (binary search) with a more detailed implementation.

## Installation ðŸ’»

To get started with the DSA Questions Repository, clone the repository using the command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage

You can explore various DSA questions and their solutions in this repository. Below is a sample implementation of the binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    return -1
```

Feel free to explore the repository, solve the questions, and contribute your solutions. Your contributions are highly encouraged!
