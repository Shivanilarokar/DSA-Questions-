### Example of a Python Function
Hereâ€™s an example of a simple Python function demonstrating a common algorithm:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2])
    return fib_sequence
```

This function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number, showcasing a practical application of recursion and iteration.

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding more questions and solutions! Happy coding! ðŸ’»
