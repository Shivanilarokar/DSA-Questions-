Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms questions along with their solutions implemented in Python.

## Overview

This repository serves as a learning platform for individuals interested in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms through practical coding problems and solutions.

## Features

- A comprehensive set of DSA questions.
- Well-documented code with clear explanations.
- Easy to navigate and contribute to.
- Solutions implemented in Python.

## Summary of Changes

In the latest commit, the README.md file was updated to remove redundant information. Specifically, two lines were deleted to streamline the content, enhancing clarity and focus on the examples provided.

### Changes Made:

- Removed the line encouraging users to open issues or submit pull requests.
- Adjusted the formatting to improve readability.

## Installation

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage

To use the provided solutions, navigate to the relevant Python files and run them using Python 3. For example, to use the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Fibonacci function:

```python
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```
