# DSA-Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the `DSA-Questions` repository by improving the documentation within the `README.md` file. The objective is to provide clearer instructions and examples for users, making it easier for new developers to understand the structure and usage of the project. By refining the content and adding illustrative examples, we aim to foster a more welcoming environment for contributors and users alike.

The changes include a more detailed overview of the repository, a concise list of highlights to showcase key features, and before-and-after code snippets that illustrate the improvements made. Additionally, breaking changes are documented to ensure users can adapt their implementations accordingly. The overall structure of the README is optimized for better readability and engagement.

## Highlights

- Improved documentation clarity
- Enhanced code examples demonstrating usage
- Clear indication of breaking changes and their implications

## Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def example_function():
    # This function does something
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
def example_function(param):
    """
    This function processes the input parameter and returns a result.
    
    Args:
        param (str): The input string to be processed.
        
    Returns:
        str: A modified version of the input string.
    """
    return param.upper()
```

## Breaking Changes

- The `example_function` now requires an argument. If called without parameters, it will raise a `TypeError`. This change improves the function's usability by making it explicit which input is needed.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

4. Validate the new functionality by invoking the updated `example_function`:
   ```python
   result = example_function("test")
   print(result)  # Should output: TEST
   ```
