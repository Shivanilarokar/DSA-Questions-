# DSA Questions

This repository offers a collection of data structure and algorithm questions designed to help developers prepare for coding interviews and enhance their problem-solving skills. Each question includes solutions and explanations, making it a valuable resource for learners and professionals alike.

## Code Example

Here’s a quick example of how to implement a binary search algorithm in Python:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```
