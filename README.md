# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces several enhancements to the `README.md` file, making it clearer and more informative for users and contributors. The primary focus was on improving the overall structure and readability of the document, ensuring that important information is easily accessible. Additionally, we have added examples and a more comprehensive guide to testing, which will help users better understand how to use the repository effectively.

The changes aim to provide a more user-friendly experience for developers and learners interested in data structures and algorithms. By refining the content and layout, we hope to foster a more engaged community around the project. This will not only help new users get started but also encourage contributions from experienced developers.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The sections have been reorganized for better flow and ease of navigation.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Added code snippets to illustrate key concepts and usage.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to run tests has been added to facilitate contributions and ensure code quality.

## Code Examples

### Before

```python
# Function to find the maximum element in a list
def find_max(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val
```

### After

```python
# Function to find the maximum element in a list
def find_max(arr):
    """Returns the maximum value in a list."""
    max_val = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val

# Example usage
result = find_max([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9])
print(result)  # Output: 9
```
