## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Project Overview**: The introduction of a clear and concise project summary helps users quickly grasp the purpose of the repository.
- **Structured Change Log**: A new section detailing what has changed and why, allowing users to track improvements and modifications.
- **Improved Code Examples**: Code snippets have been added to illustrate the implementation of various data structures and algorithms, providing practical examples for users.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of previous implementation without context
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved quicksort implementation with comments
def quicksort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array using the quicksort algorithm.
    
    :param arr: List of elements to be sorted.
    :return: Sorted list of elements.
    """
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]  # Choose pivot
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]  # Elements less than pivot
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # Elements equal to pivot
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]  # Elements greater than pivot
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)  # Recursively sort
```

## Breaking Changes

- **Updated Function Signatures**: Some function signatures have been modified to enhance readability and maintainability. Ensure to check the updated documentation for the latest function definitions.
- **Removal of Deprecated Functions**: Functions that were marked as deprecated in previous versions have been removed. Please refer to the change log for alternative implementations.

## How to Test

To verify the changes, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

3. Review the output to ensure all tests pass. If any tests fail, check the logs for specific errors and fix them accordingly.

4. For manual testing, run the provided examples in the README and validate the output against expected results.
