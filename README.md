```

## Usage
Navigate to the specific problem you want to solve and follow the instructions provided in the README of that problem.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a sample problem structure you might encounter:

### Problem: Two Sum

**Description:** Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
```
```python
# Example Usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]  # Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
```
