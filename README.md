# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the `README.md` file to improve clarity and usability for users interacting with the DSA Questions repository. The changes focus on providing clearer instructions, better organization of content, and a more intuitive layout that caters to both beginners and experienced developers. A key emphasis was placed on making the documentation more accessible, ensuring users can quickly find the information they need to effectively contribute to the repository.

Additionally, we've streamlined the examples section to provide concise before-and-after code snippets that illustrate the functionality of various data structures and algorithms. This aims to improve learning outcomes and accelerate understanding for users working through different DSA concepts.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation Structure**: The README now follows a consistent format, which includes sections for installation, usage, examples, and testing.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Added small code snippets to demonstrate the implementation of algorithms, making it easier for users to grasp concepts quickly.
- **Testing Instructions**: Clarified the testing process, ensuring that contributors can easily verify their changes before submitting pull requests.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Old code snippet
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved code snippet with type hints
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```

## Breaking Changes

While the update primarily focuses on documentation improvements, any references to outdated functions or methods have been updated to reflect the latest coding standards. Users should ensure they are using the most recent versions of the libraries mentioned in the examples.
