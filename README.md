## Overview 📚
The **DSA Questions** repository provides a structured approach to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains a collection of common DSA problems and solutions, designed to help developers improve their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Features ✨
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Well-structured code solutions
- Easy to understand and follow
- Contributions are welcome!

## Summary of the Changes 📝
In this update, the following changes were made to the `README.md` file:
- **Badges** were added to display repository size, contributors, and open issues.
- An **Overview** section was introduced to provide better context about the repository.
- Updated the **Installation** instructions for clarity.
- Enhanced the **Usage** section to guide users on navigating the repository.
- Provided an example code snippet with improved Fibonacci function implementation.

## Installation 🔧
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage 📖
Navigate to the desired directory and run the Python scripts to test the solutions.

### Example Code Snippet 🐍
Here’s a simple example of a function from the repository:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function computes the Fibonacci number for a given input `n`.
