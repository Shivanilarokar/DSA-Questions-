## Overview
Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and their solutions. It aims to help developers and students to practice and enhance their coding skills.

## Features
- Comprehensive list of DSA problems.
- Clear and concise solutions with explanations.
- Organized structure for easy navigation.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we have made significant improvements to the `README.md` file, including:

- Enhanced the descriptions under the **Features** section for improved clarity.
- Refined the example code for the binary search algorithm for better readability.
- Added an example of how to use the binary search function.

### Updated Binary Search Example
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1  # Target not found
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage
You can browse the problems and their solutions directly in the repository. To run specific examples, navigate to the relevant directory and execute the Python scripts.

## Example
To use the binary search function, you can call it as follows:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
target = 4
result = binary_search(arr, target)
print(f'Target {target} found at index: {result}')
```
