## Overview
Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions. The aim is to help learners and developers enhance their understanding and problem-solving skills in DSA.

## Features
- Comprehensive list of DSA problems.
- Well-documented solutions.
- Easy-to-navigate directory structure.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we have made significant improvements to the `README.md` file to enhance clarity and usability. Key changes include:
- Updated the title emoji from ðŸ“š to ðŸ“– for better representation.
- Improved introduction for better engagement.
- Enhanced explanation of the binary search algorithm with updated code.
- Simplified installation and usage instructions.

### Updated Binary Search Example
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1  # Target not found
```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and run your desired DSA problem solutions using Python. For example:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
result = binary_search(arr, target)
print(f'Target found at index: {result}')  # Output: Target found at index: 2
```
