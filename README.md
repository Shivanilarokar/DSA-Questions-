Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**

## Summary of the Changes
In this latest update, the README.md file has been auto-updated to include a new **Features** section and refined code examples for better clarity. The changes enhance the overall structure and readability of the documentation.

### Notable Changes:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight the repository's offerings.
- Improved the example code snippet to better illustrate function implementation.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and explore the DSA questions and solutions provided.

## Example
Here's an example of how to implement a basic data structure:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node
```

Feel free to contribute to this repository and help us grow our collection of DSA questions and solutions! Happy coding! üéâ
