Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to enhance your coding skills and deepen your understanding of various algorithms.

## Overview
The DSA Questions repository aims to help developers improve their coding skills and understanding of fundamental concepts through a comprehensive collection of DSA problems.

## Features
- A wide array of DSA problems with detailed implementations.
- Clear and concise code snippets for better understanding.
- Easy navigation and contribution guidelines.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the `README.md` file has been streamlined to enhance clarity and improve the presentation of code snippets. The following changes were made:

- Improved formatting of code snippets for better readability.
- Added clearer distinctions between "Before" and "After" code examples.
- Enhanced the installation and usage instructions for better user experience.
- Updated the contribution section to encourage community involvement.

### Code Snippet Changes
Here's an example of how the code snippets were modified for clarity:

**Before:**
```diff
-- Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
-- ```python
----def example_function():
----    # Your code here
----    pass
--+-    example_function()
---```
```

**After:**
```diff
-- Here's a sample Python code for a DSA problem:
-- ```python
++---def example_function():
++---    # Your code here
++---    pass
++++    example_function()
```
