## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Here is an example of how to use the `two_sum` function:

### Example Usage
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
```
This function takes a list of numbers and a target value, returning the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
