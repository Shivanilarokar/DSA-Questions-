## Overview

Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project aims to provide a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and their implementations in Python. It is designed to help developers improve their coding skills and understanding of fundamental concepts in Computer Science.

## Features

- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Clear and concise code implementations
- Examples provided for better understanding
- Continuous updates and improvements
- Contributions are welcome! ðŸŽ‰

## Summary of Changes

In the latest update, we have made significant improvements to the `README.md` file to enhance clarity and provide a better example of the binary search algorithm. Here are the key changes:

- Updated the example of the binary search algorithm with improved code readability.
- Enhanced the overall structure of the README to maintain professionalism and clarity.

### Updated Example of Binary Search Algorithm

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## Installation

To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository and run any of the provided algorithms in your preferred Python environment.

## Usage

Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the algorithms directly in your Python environment. Each algorithm is organized in separate files for ease of access and understanding.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an updated example of the binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Implementation as shown above
```

Happy coding! âœ¨
