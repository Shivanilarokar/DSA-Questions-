## Overview
This repository serves as a collaborative platform for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) enthusiasts. It aims to provide a collection of DSA questions along with their solutions to help learners and developers enhance their coding skills.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA questions.
- Detailed solutions to enhance understanding.
- Community-driven contributions.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced for better readability and clarity. Additionally, the Fibonacci function has been improved to handle edge cases more effectively.

### Key Changes:
- **Improved Fibonacci Function:**
  - Added checks for edge cases (e.g., when `n` is less than or equal to 0).
  - The function now returns a complete Fibonacci sequence up to `n`.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to n"""
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository and run the desired Python scripts. For example, to execute the Fibonacci function:

```bash
python fibonacci.py
```

## Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the updated Fibonacci function:

```python
result = fibonacci(10)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```
