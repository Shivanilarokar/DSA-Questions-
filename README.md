This update enhances the DSA Questions repository by refining the README.md file to improve clarity and usability. The changes focus on providing a more structured overview of the repository, including clear sections for highlights, code examples, and testing instructions. This will help new contributors and users understand the purpose of the project and how to get started quickly.

The update also includes small code snippets to illustrate key concepts, making it easier for users to grasp how to implement various data structures and algorithms. Overall, the changes aim to make the documentation more user-friendly and informative.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now includes clearly defined sections for summary, highlights, examples, and testing instructions.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets demonstrating the usage of algorithms and data structures in the repository.
- **Clarity Enhancements**: Language has been simplified to make it more accessible for users with varying levels of expertise.

### Example Code Snippets

#### Before
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        L = arr[:mid]
        R = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(L)
        merge_sort(R)

        i = j = k = 0
        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
            if L[i] < R[j]:
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
```

#### After
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    """Sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm."""
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        L = arr[:mid]
        R = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(L)
        merge_sort(R)

        i = j = k = 0
        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
            if L[i] < R[j]:
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
```
