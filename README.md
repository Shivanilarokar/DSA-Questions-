## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and their implementations in Python. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can find useful resources to enhance your coding skills.

## Features
- A collection of DSA problems and solutions.
- Well-structured code examples.
- Helpful comments to understand the implementation.

## Summary of Changes
In the latest commit, the README file has been updated to enhance clarity and presentation. Key changes include:
- Updated title formatting for better aesthetics.
- Improved code example for the binary search algorithm to enhance readability and understanding.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and explore the various DSA problems. You can run the Python scripts directly or use them as a reference for your own implementations.

## Example
Here‚Äôs an updated example of the binary search algorithm:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        # Check if target is present at mid
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
            
    return -1
```

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and enhance your understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms! üöÄ
