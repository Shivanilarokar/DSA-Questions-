# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the documentation of the DSA Questions repository by providing clearer instructions and examples for users. The README has been streamlined to focus on essential information, making it easier for both new and experienced developers to navigate the repository. Improvements include detailed explanations of the project structure, updated examples, and a more cohesive overview of the available data structures and algorithms.

Additionally, the update addresses user feedback regarding the clarity of the examples. We have added before-and-after code snippets to illustrate the changes in implementation, ensuring that users can quickly understand how to apply the concepts within their own projects. These enhancements aim to foster a better learning experience for developers tackling data structures and algorithms.

## Highlights of the Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Sections were reorganized for better flow and clarity.
- **Code Examples**: Added before-and-after examples to demonstrate practical applications of algorithms.
- **Clarified Instructions**: Enhanced explanations for setting up the environment and running the examples.

### Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def find_max(arr):
    return max(arr)
```

**After:**
```python
def find_max(arr):
    """Returns the maximum value in the array."""
    max_value = arr[0]
    for number in arr:
        if number > max_value:
            max_value = number
    return max_value
```

The updated example provides a more comprehensive approach to finding the maximum value in an array, showcasing a manual implementation that enhances understanding.

## Breaking Changes

- The function `find_max` has been modified to include a docstring for better documentation. While this does not affect functionality, it is a change that might require users to adapt their understanding of the function's usage.

## How to Test

To ensure that the changes work as expected, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Manually test the updated functions in your Python environment to verify the behavior of the changes.
