# DSA Questions Repository

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces significant enhancements to the README file, providing clearer documentation and improved examples for users. The main goal of this update is to offer better guidance for developers and learners engaging with data structures and algorithms. By improving the structure and content of the README, we aim to facilitate a smoother onboarding experience for new contributors while ensuring existing users can quickly find relevant information.

## Highlights of Changes

1. **Improved Documentation Structure**: The README now includes organized sections that make it easier to navigate through the content. This includes clearer headings and subheadings that guide users to the information they need.
  
2. **Enhanced Code Examples**: Code snippets have been added to illustrate the usage of various data structures and algorithms more effectively. These examples are concise and directly related to the topics covered.

3. **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to test the code has been included, making it simpler for users to verify that their contributions work as intended.

### Before and After Examples

## Data Structures

### Arrays
Arrays are collections of elements identified by index or key.
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(arr[0])  # Output: 1
```

### Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, where each element points to the next.
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```
```

## Breaking Changes

This update does not introduce any breaking changes; however, users are encouraged to review the new documentation format and examples to ensure they are familiar with the latest content organization.

## How to Test

To verify the changes and test the functionality of the algorithms and data structures:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

3. Run the test suite (if available):
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

4. Review the output to ensure all tests pass successfully.
