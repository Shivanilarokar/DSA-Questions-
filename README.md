## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant enhancements to the README.md file of the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal of these changes is to improve clarity and usability for new contributors and users of the repository. By restructuring the content and adding more detailed explanations, we aim to provide a better onboarding experience and encourage more contributions from the community.

The updated README now includes clearer instructions on how to navigate the repository, a more comprehensive overview of the data structures and algorithms covered, and examples that demonstrate how to implement various algorithms. These improvements not only help in understanding the project but also facilitate easier testing and contribution to the codebase.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README has been reorganized for better readability and flow.
- **Enhanced Examples**: New code examples have been added to illustrate how to use the provided data structures and algorithms.
- **Clarified Instructions**: Step-by-step guides for testing and contributing have been added to help newcomers get started quickly.

### Code Example - Sorting Algorithm

**Before:**
```python
def sort(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```

**After:**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """Perform bubble sort on a list."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

## Breaking Changes

- The method for sorting has been changed from a simple `sorted()` call to a full implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. This change is intended to provide users with a better understanding of sorting mechanisms.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Verify that all tests pass and that the new examples work as intended.
