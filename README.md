Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in hashmap:
            return [hashmap[complement], i]
        hashmap[num] = i
```
