## Installation 🚀
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage 💻
Explore the various DSA problems organized by topics. Each problem includes a description, sample inputs/outputs, and solutions.

## Example
Here’s a simple algorithm example to demonstrate usage:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_seq = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
    return fib_seq

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
