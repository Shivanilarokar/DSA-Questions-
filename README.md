## Example: Fibonacci Sequence
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Fibonacci function included in this repository:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
