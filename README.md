# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made several enhancements to the existing README.md file to improve clarity and usability for developers and contributors. The changes include a more structured layout, improved documentation of features, and clearer instructions for testing the codebase. This will help both new and experienced contributors navigate the repository more efficiently and understand the project's purpose and structure.

Additionally, we've streamlined the examples provided in the README to better illustrate how to use the data structures and algorithms included in the repository. By ensuring that the examples are concise yet comprehensive, we aim to lower the entry barrier for contributors and users alike, making it easier to implement and test various algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation Structure**: The README now follows a clearer format with distinct sections for features, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Improved Code Examples**: Examples have been refined to demonstrate the functionality of algorithms succinctly.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section has been added to guide users on how to run tests effectively.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
def example():
    # A placeholder function
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
def example_algorithm(data):
    """
    This function processes the input data and returns the result.
    
    :param data: List of integers
    :return: Sorted list of integers
    """
    return sorted(data)
```
