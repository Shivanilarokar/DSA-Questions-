# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the `README.md` file to provide clearer guidance for users and contributors of the DSA Questions repository. The primary focus of these changes is to improve the documentation regarding the various data structures and algorithms covered in this repository. By offering more comprehensive descriptions, examples, and usage guidelines, we aim to facilitate a smoother onboarding experience for new users and contributors alike.

The updated `README.md` now includes a detailed list of the algorithms implemented, their time complexities, and real-world applications. Additionally, we have added small code snippets to demonstrate how to utilize some of the key features. This is particularly useful for developers looking to quickly understand the capabilities of this repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved explanations of algorithms and data structures.
- **Code Examples**: Included relevant code snippets for better understanding.
- **Usage Guidelines**: Provided clearer instructions on how to contribute and utilize the repository.

## Algorithms

### Sorting
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  
  ```python
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
      return arr
  ```

### Searching
- **Binary Search**: A fast search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
  
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while left <= right:
          mid = left + (right - left) // 2
          if arr[mid] == target:
              return mid
          elif arr[mid] < target:
              left = mid + 1
          else:
              right = mid - 1
      return -1
  ```
```
