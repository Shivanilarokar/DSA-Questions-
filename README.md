## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems aimed at helping developers improve their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Features
- A variety of DSA problems with solutions.
- Clear and concise explanations for each problem.
- Code snippets in Python to demonstrate solutions.

## Summary of the Changes
Recent updates to the README.md include the following:
- Changed the emoji from ðŸ“š to ðŸ“– in the title for better representation.
- Added GitHub badges for forks and stars for enhanced visibility and engagement.
- Improved the wording in the contribution section to encourage exploration and contributions.

### Code Snippet Changes
Hereâ€™s a quick look at the modified code snippet in the README:

### Updated Binary Search Example
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
result = binary_search(arr, target)
print(f'Target found at index: {result}')  # Output: Target found at index: 2
```

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and run your desired DSA problem solution using Python.

## Example
```python
# Example usage of binary_search function
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
result = binary_search(arr, target)
print(f'Target found at index: {result}')  # Output: Target found at index: 2
```

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute to enhancing the collection of DSA problems! Happy coding! ðŸ˜ƒ
