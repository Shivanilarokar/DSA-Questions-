# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository focuses on enhancing the clarity and usability of the README file. The modifications include improved organization, clearer explanations of the project's purpose, and more detailed instructions on how to contribute. By refining these sections, we aim to make it easier for new contributors to understand the project and get started with solving data structure and algorithm-related problems.

Additionally, we have streamlined the sections on code examples and testing procedures. This will help users quickly find the information they need, whether they're looking to implement solutions or run tests to validate their work. Overall, these changes are geared towards fostering a more welcoming and efficient environment for collaboration.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now has a clearer layout with distinct sections for installation, usage, contributing, and testing.
- **Expanded Examples**: Code snippets have been added to illustrate how to use the algorithms and data structures featured in the repository.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on testing has been included to guide users on how to run tests effectively.

### Before and After Code Example

#### Before
```python
# Insert your algorithm code here
def example_algorithm(data):
    # Process data
    return result
```

#### After
```python
# Example of a simple algorithm implementation
def example_algorithm(data):
    processed_data = [x * 2 for x in data]  # Double each element
    return processed_data

# Usage
result = example_algorithm([1, 2, 3])
print(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

## Breaking Changes

No breaking changes were introduced in this update. All existing functionality remains intact and backward-compatible.
