# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes

This update to the `README.md` file enhances the documentation of the DSA Questions repository, providing clearer instructions and better examples for users looking to improve their data structures and algorithms skills. The changes focus on improving the structure of the README, making it easier for contributors and users to navigate the repository and understand its purpose.

The revisions include a more detailed explanation of the repository's goals, a clearer breakdown of the available algorithms, and added sections that guide users on how to implement and test the provided code. This clarity will help both new and experienced developers quickly get up to speed with the content and contribute effectively.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now has a clearer layout, with dedicated sections for installation, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Code snippets demonstrating the implementation of selected algorithms have been added to provide context.
- **Testing Instructions**: A new section detailing how to run tests has been included, ensuring that users can validate their implementations.

## Algorithms

### Sorting
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  
  ```python
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
  ```

### Searching
- **Binary Search**: A fast search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
  
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while low <= high:
          mid = (low + high) // 2
          if arr[mid] < target:
              low = mid + 1
          elif arr[mid] > target:
              high = mid - 1
          else:
              return mid
      return -1
  ```
```
