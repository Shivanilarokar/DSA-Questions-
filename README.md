## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- ü§ù **Open for contributions from the community**

## Summary of the Changes
In this recent update, the README.md file has been auto-updated to enhance the overall presentation and structure. Key changes include:
- Added a new **Usage** section to guide users on how to utilize the repository effectively.
- Improved formatting and clarity throughout the README.

### Code Changes
Here is a brief overview of the code modifications made:

1. **Fibonacci Function Update:**
   - Changed the condition for the base case in the Fibonacci function from `if n == 1:` to `if n <= 1:` to handle both base cases in a single condition.

   ```python
   # Example of a Fibonacci function
   def fibonacci(n):
       if n <= 1:  # Updated condition
           return 1
       else:
           return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
   ```
