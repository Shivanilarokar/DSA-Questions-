# DSA-Questions

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in various programming languages. It aims to provide a comprehensive resource for learners and practitioners of data structures and algorithms.

## Features
- Implementations of common algorithms
- Data structures like Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs
- Easy-to-follow examples and use cases
```

## Breaking Changes

- The interface for the `Graph` class has been modified. The method `addEdge` now requires an additional parameter for edge weight.
- The previous implementation of the `BinaryTree` class is now deprecated. Users are encouraged to migrate to the new `BinaryTreeNode` structure for better performance.
