# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes
This update introduces a significant enhancement to the README documentation, providing clearer instructions and examples for users exploring data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions. The primary goal of these changes is to improve user experience by ensuring that key information is easy to find and understand.

The updated README now includes a more structured format with sections for highlights, examples, and a testing guide. This makes it easier for contributors and users alike to navigate the repository and understand how to work with the provided resources effectively.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Improved Structure**: The README has been reorganized into well-defined sections, making it easier for users to locate information.
- **Code Examples**: Added concise before-and-after code snippets to illustrate practical implementations of DSA concepts.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to test the changes has been included, providing clarity on the testing process.

### Example Code Snippets
#### Before
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

#### After
```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
*Note: The updated version includes type hints for better readability and usability.*

## Breaking Changes
- **Function Signatures**: All functions now use type hints to improve clarity. This change may require updates to any existing code that interacts with these functions.

## How to Test
To ensure that everything is functioning as expected, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass successfully.

By following these steps, you can confirm that the updates have been implemented correctly and that the repository is functioning as intended.
