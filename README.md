## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README.md file to enhance clarity and provide better guidance for users and contributors. The changes include a more structured layout, improved formatting for code examples, and clearer instructions on how to contribute and test the code. These enhancements aim to make the repository more user-friendly and accessible to both beginners and experienced developers alike.

Additionally, we have refined the content to provide a concise overview of the project's purpose, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines. By streamlining the information presented, we hope to encourage more developers to engage with the repository and contribute their own DSA questions and solutions.

## Highlights

- **Improved Structure**: The README now follows a clear, logical flow to help users quickly find the information they need.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Code snippets are now formatted more clearly, making it easier for users to understand how to implement the data structures and algorithms discussed.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions have been added to facilitate contributions from the community, encouraging collaborative growth of the project.
