```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and start exploring the various DSA questions.

## Usage
To calculate Fibonacci numbers, you can use the `fibonacci` function as shown in the code snippet below:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

### Example of Code Snippet
Here is a sample function from the repository:

```python
def sample_function():
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance your DSA skills with our collection of questions!
