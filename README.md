## Overview
Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions. It is designed to help developers and students enhance their understanding and problem-solving skills in DSA.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems.
- Solutions provided in Python.
- Easy navigation through different problem folders.
- Code examples for better understanding.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the README.md file has been auto-updated to include an additional example demonstrating a DSA problem. This enhancement aims to provide clearer guidance for users looking to understand how to implement the various problems in the repository.

### Changes Made:
- Added an example function to illustrate how to approach a DSA problem.

```python
# Example code demonstrating a DSA problem
def example_function():
    # Your code here
    pass
```

## Installation
