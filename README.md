## Usage

Explore the various DSA questions and their solutions. Hereâ€™s an example of a simple recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers:

```python
# Example of a simple DSA question
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```
