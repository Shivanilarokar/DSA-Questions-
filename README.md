# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces significant enhancements to the README.md file, aiming to improve clarity and usability for developers and contributors. The enhancements include a more structured layout, clear section headings, and additional examples that illustrate the code's functionality. These changes are designed to help users quickly understand the purpose of the repository and how to effectively utilize the provided algorithms and data structures.

In addition to the structural improvements, we've added a dedicated section for breaking changes, ensuring that users are aware of any modifications that may affect their existing implementations. This proactive communication fosters a smoother transition and encourages best practices when upgrading to the latest version.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now features a more organized layout with distinct sections for overview, usage, examples, and testing instructions.
- **Code Examples**: We've included concise before and after code snippets to demonstrate the application of algorithms and data structures more effectively.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: A new section has been added to highlight any breaking changes, ensuring developers are well-informed about significant modifications.

### Code Examples

#### Before

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

#### After

```python
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer."""
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")
    return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n - 1)
```

The updated code includes type hints for better readability and raises an exception for invalid inputs, enhancing robustness.

## Breaking Changes

- The `factorial` function now raises a `ValueError` for negative inputs. Ensure that your implementation handles this case appropriately.

## How to Test

To test the functionality of the DSA Questions repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

Make sure to review the output of the tests to confirm that all functionalities are working as expected.
