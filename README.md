### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
This project contains various DSA questions.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions, complete with solutions and explanations. The goal is to assist developers in mastering DSA concepts through practical examples and structured learning.
```

**Code Example:**

**Before:**
```python
def example_function():
    pass
```

**After:**
```python
def example_function(data):
    """
    Process the provided data and return the result.
    
    :param data: List of integers
    :return: Sorted list of integers
    """
    return sorted(data)
```

## Breaking Changes

- The format of code examples has been standardized to include docstrings for better documentation.
- The structure of the README has been modified to ensure a logical flow of information.
