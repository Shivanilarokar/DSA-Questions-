### Example: Fibonacci Function
Here is a simple example of a Fibonacci function implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage:
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```
```
