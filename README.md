## Overview
Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project aims to provide a collection of data structures and algorithms problems with clear solutions and explanations. This repository is designed for developers and learners who are interested in improving their understanding of data structures and algorithms. It contains various problems explained in a clear and concise manner.

## Features
- A wide variety of DSA problems.
- Clear and concise solutions.
- Improved readability for code examples.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we have made significant improvements to the `README.md` file to enhance clarity and provide a better example of the binary search algorithm. Here are the key changes:
- Updated the header emoji from ðŸ“ˆ to ðŸ“– for better representation.
- Enhanced the descriptions under the **Features** section for improved clarity.
- Refined the example code for the binary search algorithm for better readability.

### Example of Updated Binary Search Code
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1  # Target not found
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and start exploring the problems and solutions. Each problem is documented with its corresponding solution.

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the algorithms directly in your Python environment. Each algorithm is organized in separate files for ease of access and understanding.

Feel free to contribute to the repository and enhance the collection of data structures and algorithms solutions!

Happy coding! âœ¨
