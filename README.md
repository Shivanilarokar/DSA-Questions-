## Overview
The DSA Questions repository offers a comprehensive collection of questions covering various algorithms and data structures. This repository serves as a valuable resource for learners and developers looking to enhance their skills in data structures and algorithms.

## Features
- Extensive collection of DSA questions.
- Well-documented solutions with explanations.
- Examples and edge case handling for key algorithms.

## Summary of the Changes üìù
In the latest commit, the following updates were made to the README.md file:
- Improved clarity and professionalism in the repository description.
- Refined the overview section to better highlight the repository's purpose.
- Adjusted the installation and usage section headings for better readability.
- Enhanced the example code snippet for the Fibonacci function, including edge case handling.

### Here are some snippets from the updated README.md:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer"
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```
This function now includes handling for edge cases, ensuring robustness.
