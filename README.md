Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ✍️ **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- 🛠️ **User-friendly structure for easy navigation**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the `README.md` file has been modified to enhance clarity and provide additional features. Key changes include:

- Added a **Features** section to highlight the main offerings of the repository.
- Updated the Fibonacci function implementation example to handle edge cases and improve readability.

### Code Changes
Here is the updated Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2])
    return fib_sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
