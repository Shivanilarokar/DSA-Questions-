In this update, we have refined the README.md file to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users of the DSA Questions repository. The primary goal of this change is to provide a more structured and informative overview of the project, making it easier for users to understand its purpose and how to contribute effectively. The new documentation includes detailed sections on highlights, usage, and a streamlined testing process.

Additionally, we have improved the code examples to better illustrate the data structures and algorithms present in the repository. These changes aim to foster a better understanding of the concepts covered in this repository and encourage more contributions from the community.

## Highlights

- Improved README structure for clarity and ease of navigation.
- Added usage examples for common data structures and algorithms.
- Enhanced contribution guidelines to help new contributors get started quickly.
