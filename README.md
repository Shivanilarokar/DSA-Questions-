# DSA Questions

## Summary

This update to the DSA Questions repository introduces enhancements to the README file, providing clearer instructions and improved examples for users. The goal is to make it easier for developers and learners to navigate the repository, understand its purpose, and implement the data structures and algorithms effectively. As the repository evolves, clear documentation becomes crucial for fostering a collaborative and educational environment.

The changes focus on summarizing the repository's content, highlighting key features, and providing concise before-and-after examples that illustrate how to utilize the algorithms effectively. This will not only help users get started quickly but also encourage best practices in implementing data structures and algorithms.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The README now has a more organized layout, making it easier to find relevant information.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Code snippets have been updated to reflect best practices and provide clearer before-and-after scenarios.
- **Added Testing Instructions**: A new section has been added to guide users on how to run tests effectively.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a simple algorithm
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
# Improved example with type hints and docstring
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Adds two integers and returns the result.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first integer.
    b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the two integers.
    """
    return a + b
```
