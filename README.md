## Summary of Changes

This update introduces several enhancements to the `README.md` file, aimed at improving clarity and usability for contributors and users of the DSA Questions repository. By restructuring the content and adding essential information, we aim to foster a better understanding of the projectâ€™s scope and how to effectively contribute to it. The new layout provides a more comprehensive overview of the project, highlights key features, and simplifies the onboarding process for new contributors.

In addition to the structural changes, we've incorporated small code examples to illustrate the functionality of the data structures and algorithms being discussed. This hands-on approach will allow users to grasp the concepts more easily and apply them in practice. The README now serves not only as documentation but also as a practical guide to understanding and utilizing the codebase.
