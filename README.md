## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant improvements to the `README.md` file to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. These changes focus on providing a more structured overview of the project, improving documentation for setup and usage, and offering clearer examples. The goal is to make it easier for developers to understand how to contribute to the project and utilize its features.

Additionally, we've restructured sections for better readability and added more detailed explanations of the algorithms and data structures covered in this repository. This should help both novice and experienced developers to navigate through the material more effectively and find the information they need quickly.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README has been reorganized to feature distinct sections, making it easier to find information.
- **Enhanced Examples**: New code snippets have been added to demonstrate the usage of various algorithms and data structures.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clearer instructions on how to contribute to the repository have been included.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  
  ```python
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
      return arr
  ```

### Searching Algorithms
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
  
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
      while left <= right:
          mid = (left + right) // 2
          if arr[mid] == target:
              return mid
          elif arr[mid] < target:
              left = mid + 1
          else:
              right = mid - 1
      return -1
  ```
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update. All existing functionality remains intact, and the new structure is designed to enhance the user experience without disrupting previous usage patterns.
