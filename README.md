# DSA Questions Repository Update

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have revamped the `README.md` file to improve clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The aim is to present a more structured and informative guide that helps users navigate the repository, understand its purpose, and quickly get started with contributing. The changes include enhanced sections on project highlights, examples, and testing instructions, ensuring that both new and experienced developers can find the information they need efficiently.

Additionally, we have included before-and-after examples to illustrate the impact of the updates made to the codebase. These examples highlight how certain functions have been optimized or modified, providing clear context for the changes. This will serve to not only document the evolution of the code but also assist contributors in understanding best practices for their own contributions.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The README now has a clearer hierarchy with distinct sections for summary, highlights, examples, and testing instructions.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Added before-and-after code snippets to illustrate updates made in the codebase, showcasing improvements and changes.
- **Clearer Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section on how to test changes has been included, providing step-by-step guidance for users.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**After:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```
In the updated function, we have added type hints to improve code readability and usability, making it clearer what types of arguments the function expects.
