### Notable Changes:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight the repository's offerings.
- Improved the example code snippet to better illustrate function implementation.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
This repository provides a structured way to practice DSA questions. You can navigate through various topics and find questions that suit your learning needs.

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to implement a basic function for a DSA question:

```python
# Example Python Code for a DSA Question
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```
