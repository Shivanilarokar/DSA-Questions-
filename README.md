## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant enhancements to the `README.md` file of the DSA Questions repository. These adjustments aim to improve clarity and usability for developers and contributors who are navigating through our project. By refining our documentation, we ensure that users can quickly understand the purpose of the repository, the structure of the codebase, and how to contribute effectively.

Additionally, we have included more detailed examples and guidelines, which serve to illustrate the functionality of key features. This not only aids in onboarding new contributors but also enhances the overall user experience by providing clear, actionable instructions.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation Structure**: The README now follows a logical flow, making it easier to find information.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: We've added concise code snippets to demonstrate usage and best practices.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section has been added to guide users on how to run tests, ensuring that contributors can validate their changes effectively.

### Before and After Examples
