## Summary of Changes

This update enhances the `README.md` file to provide clearer guidance and better organization for users and contributors. The primary focus was on improving the structure of the documentation, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the purpose and usage of the repository. Additionally, we have added a section that highlights key features and usage examples to facilitate quicker onboarding for new users.

The updated README now includes a more detailed explanation of the project, along with a set of small before-and-after code examples that illustrate the changes made to the codebase. This will help users see the benefits of the updates and how they can effectively use the repository in their own data structure and algorithm (DSA) learning journey.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation Structure**: The README is now organized into clearly defined sections, making it easier to find relevant information.
- **Code Examples**: Added before-and-after snippets to demonstrate the practical applications of the code.
- **User Guidance**: More comprehensive instructions for getting started, contributing, and testing the code.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

#### After
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```
The updated function now includes type hints and a docstring for better clarity and usability.

## Breaking Changes

- Type hints have been added to various functions throughout the codebase. This may require users to adjust their function calls if they were using the previous versions without type annotations.

## How to Test

To test the changes made in this update, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
