Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- 📚 **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ✍️ **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- 🧑‍💻 **User-friendly structure for easy navigation**

## Summary of Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced to include a new section featuring a simple example of a Fibonacci sequence implementation in Python. The previous example of binary search has been removed to streamline the content. Additionally, the formatting has been improved for better readability.

## Installation
To get started with the repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
# Install dependencies (if any)
```

## Usage
Here is a simple DSA implementation example:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_seq = fibonacci(n - 1)
        fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
        return fib_seq

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

Feel free to explore and enhance your DSA skills! Happy coding! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
