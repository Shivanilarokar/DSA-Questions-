# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update to the `DSA Questions` repository enhances the README file to provide clearer instructions and better organization. The primary goal is to improve user experience by ensuring that new contributors and users can easily navigate the documentation and understand how to utilize the repository effectively. This update includes a summary of features, usage examples, and testing instructions, making it easier for developers to get started with the data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions provided in this repository.

Several key sections have been added or modified to reflect the latest changes. The README now includes a more concise overview of the repository's purpose, a highlights section that outlines the key features, and practical examples demonstrating how to implement various algorithms. Additionally, this version addresses common questions and provides essential information for testing the codebase, ensuring that users can verify their implementations quickly.

## Highlights

- Improved documentation structure for better readability.
- Added usage examples for key algorithms.
- Included a comprehensive "How to Test" section.

## Code Examples

### Before

```python
# Old code example
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### After

```python
# Improved code example with type hints
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```

This update also clarifies how to handle edge cases and provides additional context for each algorithm. For instance, the sorting algorithm examples now include time complexity analysis, helping users choose the right approach for their specific needs.

## Breaking Changes

- The function signatures have been updated to include type hints for better clarity.
- Some of the examples have been restructured to align with the new documentation standards, which may require minor adjustments in user implementations.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```
