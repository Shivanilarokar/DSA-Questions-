Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project aims to provide a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions to help you enhance your coding skills.

## Overview
This repository is designed for developers and learners who are interested in improving their understanding of data structures and algorithms. It contains various problems along with their solutions, explained in a clear and concise manner.

## Features
- A wide variety of DSA problems.
- Clear and structured solutions.
- Code examples that are easy to follow.
- Regular updates to enhance content clarity and usability.

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, we have made significant improvements to the `README.md` file to enhance clarity and provide a better example of the binary search algorithm. Here are the key changes:
- Updated the example of the binary search algorithm with improved code readability.
- Enhanced the overall structure of the README to maintain professionalism and clarity.

### Updated Example of Binary Search Algorithm
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1  # Target not found
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and start exploring the problems and solutions. Each problem is documented with its corresponding solution.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the binary search function:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5
result = binary_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element found at index: {result}")
else:
    print("Element not found in array.")
```

Happy coding! âœ¨
