- Added a new section at the end for additional repository information and a thank you note to users.

### Code Changes
```python
def example_problem(input_data):
    # Example logic to solve a problem
    result = process(input_data)  # Updated to reflect actual processing logic
    return result
```

## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:
