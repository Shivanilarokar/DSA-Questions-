Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This repository offers a comprehensive collection of questions covering various data structures and algorithms, along with well-documented solutions and explanations. This resource is perfect for students and professionals looking to enhance their problem-solving skills.

## Overview

The DSA Questions repository serves as a valuable resource for learners and developers looking to enhance their skills in data structures and algorithms.

## Features üîç
- Well-documented solutions with explanations.
- Coverage of a variety of data structures and algorithms.
- Contribution-friendly environment for sharing knowledge.

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been enhanced to improve clarity and engagement:

- **Introduction Update**: The introduction section has been rephrased for better readability.
- **Overview Section Added**: A new section has been added to provide a succinct overview of the repository's purpose.
- **Code Snippet Improvement**: Added an example of edge case handling in the Fibonacci function, demonstrating robustness in solutions.

### Code Snippet Example
Here‚Äôs an updated example of the Fibonacci function, now with improved edge case handling:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer"
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
print(fibonacci(0))  # Output: Input should be a positive integer
```

This function now includes handling for edge cases, ensuring robustness.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
```

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

## Usage
