Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This repository is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and their solutions, designed to help you understand and practice essential concepts in programming.

## Features
- Comprehensive collection of DSA problems
- Well-documented solutions
- Easy to navigate and contribute

## Summary of the Changes
Recent updates have enhanced the `README.md` file with clearer instructions and additional details, including:
- Improved cloning instructions
- Enhanced the Fibonacci function logic
- A closing note to encourage contributions

### Notable Code Changes
- **Improved Cloning Instructions:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
  cd DSA-Questions-
  ```
  
- **Fibonacci Function Logic Update:**
  ```python
  def fibonacci(n):
      if n <= 0:  # Changed from n == 0 to n <= 0
          return 0
      elif n == 1:
          return 1
  ```

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repo to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-.git
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Fibonacci function included in this repository:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
