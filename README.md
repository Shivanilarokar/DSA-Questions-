# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant enhancements to the `README.md` file to improve clarity and usability for contributors and users of the DSA Questions repository. Key areas of improvement include expanded documentation on usage, better structure for navigating through the repository, and a more comprehensive overview of the project's goals. The goal of these changes is to ensure that both new and experienced users can easily understand the purpose and functionality of this repository.

Additionally, we have included examples of data structures and algorithms covered in the repository, making it easier for users to get started with practical implementations. This will not only help users to grasp the concepts quickly but also serve as a reference for best practices when implementing data structures and algorithms in their own projects.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: The README now provides a clearer overview of the repository's objectives and how to utilize the available resources.
- **Code Examples**: Added small code snippets demonstrating the implementation of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Structured Navigation**: Enhanced section headers and added a table of contents for easier navigation.

### Before and After Code Examples

**Before:**
```python
# Example of a simple list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list)
```

**After:**
```python
# Example of a simple list with functions
def print_list(lst):
    for item in lst:
        print(item)

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print_list(my_list)
```
