Welcome to the **DSA Questions** repository! This project serves as a platform for developers and learners to practice and enhance their skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions.

## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**
- üîç **User-friendly structure for easy navigation**

## Summary of the Changes
In this update, the README.md file has been auto-updated to enhance clarity and engagement. The following changes were made:
- Added a **Features** section to highlight the key aspects of the repository.
- Included an **Example** section with a code snippet for a simple DSA implementation.
- Updated the **Usage** section to provide more clarity on how to use the repository.

## Installation
To get started with the DSA Questions repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
```

## Usage
Instructions on how to use the repository will be provided here. Explore the collection of DSA questions and solutions. Feel free to contribute by submitting your own questions and solutions!

## Example
Here is a simple DSA implementation example:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    fib_seq = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_seq.append(fib_seq[i-1] + fib_seq[i-2])
    return fib_seq

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
