Clearer instructions and additional context have been added to help new contributors and users navigate the repository more effectively. The changes aim to provide a better understanding of the project’s purpose, structure, and how to get started with contributing or using the code.

In addition to documentation improvements, we've included small code examples to illustrate the usage of specific data structures and algorithms. This should make it easier for users to grasp the concepts and see practical applications of the code provided in the repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- Improved clarity and structure of the README to facilitate easier navigation.
- Added sections for code examples, demonstrating practical usage of algorithms.
- Enhanced the contribution guidelines to encourage community involvement.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**

```markdown
# DSA Questions
This repo contains questions and solutions.
```

**After:**

```markdown
# DSA Questions

Welcome to the DSA Questions repository! This project contains a collection of data structure and algorithm questions along with their solutions, intended to help learners and practitioners enhance their problem-solving skills.

## Code Example

Here’s a quick example of how to implement a simple binary search:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```
