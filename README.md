# Project Title

A brief description of your project goes here. This project provides a set of tools for developers to streamline their workflows. It includes functions for data processing, API interaction, and more.

## What's New

- Added two new functions:
  - **`process_data(input_list: List[int]) -> int`**: Processes a list of integers and returns a single integer result.
  - **`fetch_data(url: str) -> dict`**: Fetches JSON data from a given URL and returns it as a dictionary.
- Removed deprecated functions that were no longer needed. The `old_function` was replaced by `process_data`.

## Installation

To install this project, use the following command:

```bash
pip install project-title
```

## Usage Examples

### Using `process_data`

Here is an example of how to use the `process_data` function:

```python
from project import process_data

result = process_data([1, 2, 3])
print(result)  # Output will depend on the implementation of process_data
```

### Using `fetch_data`

Fetch data from an API endpoint:

```python
from project import fetch_data

data = fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data")
print(data)  # Output will be the JSON data fetched from the specified endpoint
```
