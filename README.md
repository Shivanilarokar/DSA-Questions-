## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have enhanced the `DSA-Questions` repository by improving the clarity of the README documentation. The primary focus was to provide better insights into the purpose of the repository, highlight key features, and outline usage instructions for potential contributors. This change aims to create a more welcoming environment for developers interested in data structures and algorithms.

Additionally, we have incorporated detailed examples to illustrate how to effectively utilize the provided algorithms and data structures. By doing so, we hope to facilitate easier onboarding for new users and contributors, allowing them to quickly grasp the functionality and implementation of the solutions offered in this repository.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: The README now includes a clearer overview of the repository's purpose and structure.
- **Usage Examples**: Added concise examples to demonstrate the usage of various algorithms and data structures.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Provided a section on how to contribute to the repository, encouraging community engagement.

### Example Usage

Before:

```python
# Example function
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```

After:

```python
# Example: Sorting an Array
# This function sorts the input array in ascending order.

def sort_array(arr):
    """
    Sorts the given array using Python's built-in sorted function.
    
    :param arr: List of elements to be sorted
    :return: Sorted list of elements
    """
    return sorted(arr)

# Usage
sorted_array = sort_array([5, 3, 8, 1])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 8]
```
