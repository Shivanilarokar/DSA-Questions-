## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved README Structure**: The organization of the README has been streamlined for better readability.
- **Enhanced Code Examples**: Added more comprehensive examples demonstrating the use of algorithms and data structures.
- **Clarified Testing Instructions**: Updated the "How to Test" section to provide clearer steps for running tests.

### Before and After Examples

#### Before
```python
# Example of a basic sorting algorithm
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

#### After
```python
# Enhanced example of a basic sorting algorithm with comments
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm.
    
    :param arr: List of integers to be sorted
    :return: Sorted list of integers
    """
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already sorted
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Swap if the element found is greater
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this update; existing functionality remains intact, and all previous examples and code snippets are still valid.

## How to Test

To test the updates made to the repository:
