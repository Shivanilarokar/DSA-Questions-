## Features
- üìö **Comprehensive collection of DSA questions**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Detailed solutions and explanations**

## Summary of the Changes
In the latest update, the `README.md` file has been modified to:
- Enhance the structure by adding a new **Features** section.
- Improve code readability in the example implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Reword the closing statement for a more engaging user experience.

## Installation
To get started with the repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivanilarokar/DSA-Questions-
cd DSA-Questions-
# Install dependencies (if any)
```

## Usage
Instructions on how to use the repository will be provided here. Explore the collection of DSA questions and solutions. Feel free to contribute by submitting your own questions and solutions!

## Example
Here is a simple DSA implementation example:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_seq = fibonacci(n - 1)
        fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
        return fib_seq

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

Feel free to explore and enhance your DSA skills! Happy coding! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
