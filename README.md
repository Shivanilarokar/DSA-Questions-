### Example of Fibonacci Function Implementation
Here’s an example implementation of a Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

This function calculates the Fibonacci number for a given `n`, demonstrating recursion.
