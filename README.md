## Features ‚ú®
- A wide array of DSA problems categorized for easy navigation.
- Detailed solutions and explanations to help understand each problem.
- Example code snippets to illustrate the implementations.
- Regular updates and contributions from the community.

## Summary of the Changes üõ†Ô∏è
Recent updates to the README.md include enhancements to clarify the project purpose and improve the code examples. Key modifications are as follows:

- Consolidated badges for GitHub stars and forks.
- Added a detailed implementation of the `binary_search` function.
- Updated the example usage section for better clarity and usability.

### Updated Binary Search Example
Here‚Äôs a quick look at the modified code snippet in the README:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        # Check if target is present at mid
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        # If target is greater, ignore left half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        # If target is smaller, ignore right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    return -1  # Target not found
```
