# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we've made significant improvements to the README.md file to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users of the DSA Questions repository. The updated documentation provides a more structured overview of the repository, clear instructions for contributing, and a comprehensive breakdown of the data structures and algorithms covered. By streamlining the content, we aim to facilitate a better onboarding experience for new contributors and improve the overall accessibility of the repository.

Furthermore, we've added examples that illustrate the application of various data structures and algorithms. These examples serve as practical references for users looking to understand the implementation details and potential use cases of each algorithm. This change not only enriches the documentation but also aligns it more closely with industry standards for open-source projects.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Enhanced Structure**: The README now follows a more organized format, making it easier to navigate through sections.
- **Detailed Examples**: Added small code snippets that demonstrate key algorithms and data structures.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clearer instructions on how to contribute to the project, including coding standards and testing procedures.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions
This repo contains various DSA questions.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data structure and algorithm questions, along with implementations and solutions in various programming languages.

## Examples
### Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has been significantly altered. All contributors should review the new format to ensure compliance with the updated guidelines.
