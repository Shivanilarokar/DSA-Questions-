# DSA Questions

## Summary of Changes

This update introduces significant enhancements to the `README.md` file of the DSA Questions repository. It aims to provide clearer guidance for contributors and users by organizing the content into well-defined sections. This includes a more structured overview of the project, improved examples of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) usage, and essential testing instructions. The goal is to make it easier for new contributors to understand the project's purpose and how to contribute effectively.

In addition, we have implemented a section for breaking changes to inform users about any modifications that could affect their current implementations. This transparency is vital for maintaining a healthy development environment, especially in an open-source context where collaboration and communication are key.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Structure**: The `README.md` now includes distinct sections for Project Overview, Examples, Breaking Changes, and Testing Instructions.
- **Enhanced Examples**: Code snippets have been added to illustrate how to use various DSA algorithms effectively.
- **Breaking Changes Section**: A dedicated section has been included to highlight any breaking changes that users need to be aware of.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**

The previous `README.md` lacked clear examples and a structured layout, making it difficult for newcomers to navigate the repository.

**After:**

## Example Usage

### Sorting Algorithm

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Usage
sorted_array = bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The function `old_sorting_function()` has been deprecated. Users should now use `new_sorting_function()` instead. The new function has a different signature, and users are encouraged to update their code accordingly.

## How to Test

To ensure that the changes are functioning as expected, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Questions.git
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests/
   ```

3. Verify that all tests pass and review the output for any errors or warnings.

4. Review the updated `README.md` for clarity and completeness.
