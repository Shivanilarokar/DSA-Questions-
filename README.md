## Summary of Changes

This update to the DSA Questions repository enhances the existing documentation in the `README.md` file, providing clearer instructions and examples for users looking to solve data structure and algorithm problems. The goal is to improve accessibility for new contributors and users by offering concise explanations and visual aids, making it easier to navigate through the repository and utilize its resources effectively.

Additionally, we have streamlined the examples provided within the documentation, ensuring that they are relevant and directly applicable to the problems presented in the repository. This will help users quickly grasp the concepts and implementations without unnecessary overhead.

## Highlights of Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced clarity and detail in the `README.md`.
- **Code Examples**: Added succinct before-and-after code snippets to illustrate the usage of data structures and algorithms.
- **Navigation Aids**: Included section headers and bullet points for easier navigation.

### Before and After Examples

**Before:**
```markdown
## Searching Algorithms
We have several searching algorithms implemented.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Searching Algorithms

### Linear Search
```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for index, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value == target:
            return index
    return -1
```

### Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```
