# DSA Questions Repository

## Summary of Changes

In this update, we have made significant improvements to the README documentation to enhance clarity and usability for contributors and users alike. The primary goal of this revision was to better outline the structure of the repository, making it easier for new developers to navigate and utilize the available data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions. This will help streamline contributions and encourage more community engagement.

Additionally, we have introduced examples that illustrate how to approach solving specific DSA problems. By providing these concise examples, we aim to reduce the learning curve for newcomers and foster a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts. 

## Highlights of Changes

- **Expanded Documentation**: The README now contains a more detailed explanation of the repository's purpose and structure.
- **Code Examples**: Added small, illustrative code snippets that demonstrate how to implement solutions for common DSA problems.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clarified the steps for contributing to the repository to encourage more community involvement.

### Before and After

**Before:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions
A repository for data structure and algorithm problems.
```

**After:**
```markdown
# DSA Questions Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data structure and algorithm problems designed for practice and learning.

## Code Example
Here's a simple example of a binary search implementation:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
```

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of the README has been revamped for improved readability and organization. Ensure to review the new sections and examples for a better understanding of the repository.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/DSA-Questions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Questions
   ```
3. Review the README.md file for the updated documentation and examples.
4. Run the provided code examples to verify their correctness:
   ```bash
   python -c "from your_module import binary_search; print(binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3))"
   ```
