# DSA Questions - README Update

## Summary of Changes
In this update, we have enhanced the `README.md` file to provide clearer instructions and a more comprehensive overview of the DSA Questions repository. This improvement aims to better serve developers and contributors by offering a more structured format that highlights key features, usage examples, and contribution guidelines. 

Additionally, we've streamlined the content to ensure that new users can quickly understand the purpose of the repository and how to effectively utilize and contribute to it. This update reflects our commitment to fostering an inclusive and user-friendly environment for developers at all levels.

## Highlights of Changes
- **Enhanced Structure**: The README now follows a more logical flow, with distinct sections for summary, highlights, examples, and testing instructions.
- **Improved Code Examples**: We have included small before-and-after code snippets to illustrate important concepts and usage clearly.
- **Testing Instructions**: A dedicated section detailing how to run tests has been added to facilitate easier contributions and ensure code quality.

### Before/After Code Examples
#### Before
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
#### After
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b
```
In the updated example, we have added type hints and a docstring to improve code clarity and maintainability.

## Breaking Changes
- The function signatures have been updated to include type hints across all functions. Ensure that your implementations align with these new definitions to maintain compatibility.
