    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"{amount} deposited. New balance: ₹{self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds!")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"{amount} withdrawn. New balance: ₹{self.balance}")

    def show_balance(self):
        print(f"Current balance: ₹{self.balance}")
```
